If your house was built before the 1970s, we strongly encourage that you work with a plumbing professional to check your house's plumbing and examine if there are locations that need repiping. If your house was constructed decades prior to that, chances are that your home may need substantial repiping so that your house's plumbing can function at ideal rates.</p>
