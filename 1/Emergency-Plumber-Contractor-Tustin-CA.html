<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to check the line and determine the cause of the issue. The line was clearly degrading; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
