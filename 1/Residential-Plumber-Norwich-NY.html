Backflow into a public water supply can infect the water or pollute because system (i.e., backflow into a public water supply can make the water in that system unusable or hazardous to consume), and each water supplier has a duty to provide water that is usable and safe to consume under all foreseeable situations. In addition, customers typically have outright faith that water delivered to them through a public water system is constantly safe to consume. For these factors, your water district must take precautions to protect its public water system against backflow.</p>
<p>If you get your water from a neighborhood water system, check to see if your community currently softens the water.
