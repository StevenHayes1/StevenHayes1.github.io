<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that removes hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses among the most prevalent and terrible water problems: difficult water.  Tough water wreaks havoc on the modern-day home. Scale builds up in your pipes, clogging them and reducing water pressure.  Scale considerably shortens the life expectancy of home appliances like dishwashers, coffee machine and ice machines.
