<h3>How to Clear Clogged Drains Without Calling a Plumber in Chadbourn NC</h3>
<p>We are a licensed and insured  drain cleaning contractor who can clear out difficult drain clogs and leave them working fresh once again. The typical cost to install a gas line for a kitchen stove is $15 to $25 per linear foot. Overall costs range from $200 to $1,000 or more depending upon the length of piping required to connect to the main gas supply, which generally averages 30'.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Many home centers bring only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" model, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>In addition to the garbage disposal system, there are a number of upgrades and parts that you may need to take into account when weighing the garbage disposal installation cost. For example, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, decreased or then unfavorable pressure in the 2-inch supply line will cause a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
<p>Water heater repair and hot water heater installation are frequently delayed as long as possible. A hot water heater is an expensive plumbing appliance, and we tend to press off changing it till it breaks beyond repair. It is also a piece of plumbing equipment that we ignore up until we get up to a cold shower. We might hear the water heater making noise, trying to tell us there is a problem, but we overlook it which may result in a more extensive repair that if we would have nipped it in the bud. It's important to get out in front of any problems as quick as possible. The quicker you respond to a concern, the much better chance you'll have to save time and money on water heater services.</p>
