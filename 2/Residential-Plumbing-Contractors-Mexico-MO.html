<p>This veteran Oregon plumbing business looks after both commercial and residential plumbing repairs. P-trap. If the P-trap under you sink is clogged, it can cause water to construct all the way up your drains and produce a leak somewhere along the way.

Some even choose silicone sealant, though it's more difficult to eliminate.</p>
