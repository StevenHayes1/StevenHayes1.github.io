<p>Poorly set up gas lines result in gas leaks. Gas leakages are pricey to repair. Gas line installation is not a diy project. The gas lines have to be adjusted to the right levels by a certified professional. The United States Department of Energy states that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the 2nd highest energy consuming area of a home, next to heating and cooling. The amount of minerals liquified in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>
<p>Sometimes, your faucet can be the one triggering sink concerns.
