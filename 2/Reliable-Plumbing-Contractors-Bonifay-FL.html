Like almost whatever in life, there's a bad and great side to both gas and electrical hot water heater.

<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which eliminates calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the salt ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
