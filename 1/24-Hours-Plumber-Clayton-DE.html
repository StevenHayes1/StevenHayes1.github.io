Copper has been the favored choice to replace galvanized iron pipes (which used to be considered very strong, but they were discovered to split under pressure and tend to rust within a couple of years). Today, a lot of quality contractors utilize PEX or copper pipes.</p>
<p>We use both metal and plastic pipes in our repiping procedure. Because it is long enduring and durable, copper is the industry standard.
