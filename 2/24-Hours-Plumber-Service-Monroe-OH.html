<p>Hard water is softened by getting rid of the calcium and magnesium it contains. When hard water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (hardness) ions are removed through an ion exchange process, so just softened water travels through to your house. When the resin bed fills with solidity ions, it should be regrowed (cleaned). Salt is generally utilized in the regrowth process and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to introduce a chemical substance that serves as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and remain suspended in the water rather than developing on surfaces.
