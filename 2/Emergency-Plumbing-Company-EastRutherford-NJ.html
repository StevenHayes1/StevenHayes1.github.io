<p>Root Invasion: Root invasion refers to what takes place when tree roots start to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This happens due to the fact that the wetness in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots ultimately do piece your drain lines, they can cause obstructions, breaks, and back-ups which might lead to extensive property damage. Keep an eye out for damp, green patches in your lawn, a persistent sewage smell in or around your house, an uptick in rodent and insect activity, and slow drains, as these are all common indications of root intrusion.</p>
