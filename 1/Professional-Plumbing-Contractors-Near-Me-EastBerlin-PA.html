Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
