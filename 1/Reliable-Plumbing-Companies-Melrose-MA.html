<p>Sewer backups can be reported to (503) 823-1700. A response crew is readily available for preliminary examination of sewer emergencies every day of the year. Call the City's sewer and drainage maintenance personnel at (503) 823-1700 if sewage from the City-maintained portion of the sewer system backs up through toilets or sinks. City workers will inspect and eliminate blockages in the mainline sewer and the part of the service line that the City is accountable for.

<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of major surgery, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with often. When your water lines are repiped, it just implies old copper and galvanized pipes are changed with new pipes. We find that houses 15 years or older who have actually never ever had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. If you have an older home and are experiencing regular and major leakages, you could be in need of water line repiping. If you do have regular leaks, we discover that repiping can really be the cheaper and better long-term service.</p>
