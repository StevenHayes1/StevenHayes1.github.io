<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved successful, Sam Blanc created and built a smaller design that operated on the exact same concept however could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also built a much bigger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and municipal sewer pipes. An improved version called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
<p>Find out if there are any lead pipes in the home. Homes that were developed prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how useful, is an ecological toxin (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have children, you might not want to live in a house that has lead pipes.</p>

As a homeowner or business owner, those peace of minds can be extremely, extremely nice to hear.
