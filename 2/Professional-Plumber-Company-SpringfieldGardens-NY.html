<p>You have actually most likely seen drain cleaner items on the racks at your local home improvement shop, so when your drain gets clogged or isn't draining water like it should, you may be tempted to head down there and pick some as much as fix it on your own.

<p>Contact Grace Plumbing at (832) 734-9731 We can help determine the most affordable option if you think it's time to think about repiping your house. If you have a more recent unit, a basic repair or replacing private parts might be all that's required to get your hot water heater working once again. With time tree roots can crush drains. Jenni Plumber has a Complete Color Video Camera Inspection to fully inspect your drain and discover the source of your sewer drain clog. By finding precisely the area that is clogged our plumbing contractors can help minimize the costs of repairs.</p>
<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to check the line and determine the reason for the issue. The line was clearly deteriorating; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
