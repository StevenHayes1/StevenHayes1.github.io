<p>Poorly installed gas lines result in gas leakages. Gas leakages are expensive to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself job. The gas lines have to be calibrated to the best levels by a certified professional. The United States Department of Energy states that water heating can represent 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your house." It is the 2nd highest energy consuming area of a home, next to cooling and heating. The amount of minerals liquified in water can trigger it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy costs.</p>

However, in a correctly working toilet, the water should stop running as soon as the bowl is filled to its suitable capability.

These leaks are extremely wasteful, as more than a hundred gallons of water end up traveling through the overflow.</p>
