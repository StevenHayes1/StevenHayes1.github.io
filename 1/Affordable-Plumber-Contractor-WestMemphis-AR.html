Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
