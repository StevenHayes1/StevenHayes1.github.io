<p>Backflow preventers are crucial for producing a safe water system system. No matter which design you choose, all water softeners need to be properly kept. The brine service should be mixed and kept in the brine tank. Routine blocking of the resin likewise requires unique attention. For instance, if the raw water supply is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. Often, typical backwashing with water will fix this issue. If not, gradually stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help break up the product. Likewise, fungi and germs also form mats in the resin that minimize its effectiveness. Disinfecting the water prior to softening or regularly cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these nuisances. Nevertheless, check out the maker's guidelines before including any chemicals to the unit.</p>
