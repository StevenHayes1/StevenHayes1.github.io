<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might discover on Google. I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me an estimate. They instantly cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional examination, there was a significant blockage that needed excavation to investigate.

After fixing this initial problem and installing a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
