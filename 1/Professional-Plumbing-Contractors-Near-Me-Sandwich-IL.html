<p>The typical service is to have the faulty pipes replaced when you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is a choice to consider if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing.
