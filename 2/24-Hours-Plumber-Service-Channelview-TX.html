Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
