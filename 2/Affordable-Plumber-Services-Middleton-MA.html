<p>Know that softened water includes trace amounts of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water consists of about the same amount of salt as a piece of bread.

<p>Wooden pipes were utilized in London and somewhere else during the 16th and 17th centuries. The pipes were hollowed-out logs which were tapered at the end with a small hole in which the water would travel through. 21 The multiple pipes were then sealed together with hot animal fat. Wood pipes were used in Philadelphia, 22 Boston, and Montreal in the 1800s. Built-up wooden tubes were commonly used in the U.S.A. throughout the 20th century. These pipes (used in place of corrugated iron or strengthened concrete pipes) were made of areas cut from short lengths of wood. Locking of nearby rings with wood dowel pins produced a versatile structure. About 100,000 feet of these wood pipes were installed during WW2 in drainage culverts, storm sewage systems and channels, under highways and at army camps, marine stations, airfields and ordnance plants.</p>

If the cost of a repair is over half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more monetary sense to replace your hot water heater.</p>
