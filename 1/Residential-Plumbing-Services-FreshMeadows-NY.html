<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service FreshMeadows NY</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to deal with difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Mechanical backflow preventers have internal seals, springs and moving parts that go through fouling, wear or fatigue. Likewise, mechanical backflow preventers and air spaces can be bypassed. For that reason, all backflow preventers have to be evaluated occasionally to guarantee they are operating properly. A visual check of air gaps is sufficient, but mechanical backflow preventers need to be tested with appropriately calibrated gauge equipment.</p>

<p>Eventually, however, the beads reach optimal capability and can't attract any more mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regrowed, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank is available in. An on-board computer determines the amount of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration instantly starts. For a three-bedroom house and household of 4, regeneration typically occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
