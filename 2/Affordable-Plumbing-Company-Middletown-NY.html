<p>Drain pipe is not secured using the needed solvent cement (end of the pipe ought to be cut straight). ABS fitting is glued to PVC pipe. ABS and PVC are not actually glued in the regular sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is really a solvent that melts the surfaces of the pipe and fitting for a couple of seconds. Broken Pipes: Pipes are cracked, punctured or collapsed by moving soil, frozen ground, settling, and so on</p>
<p>At least when every 3 months, drain water from the tank. Gradually sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can hamper efficiency, and draining a gallon or two assists get rid of the sediment. If you spot a leak and go with a patching task instead of a repiping job, simply bear in mind that all the pipes in your home are most likely made from the same material and they might be next. To prevent even more, more-costly repairs (like water damage from burst pipes), you might want to think about repiping your whole house when you find a leak.</p>
