<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adapt to your business' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high flow demand, tanks come online to add flow rate capacity. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line.
