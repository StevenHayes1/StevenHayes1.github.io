<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a severe public health danger if they do not have appropriate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are numerous, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, triggered the spread of sickness or illness.</p>
<p>When the drinkable supply piping is connected to a system or component which exceeds the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may occur. Greater pressure can be caused by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Non-potable and drinkable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system if these connections are not properly secured.</p>
<p>A minimum of 12 inches of clear space will be maintained above the assembly to enable servicing check valves and for operation of shut-off valves.
