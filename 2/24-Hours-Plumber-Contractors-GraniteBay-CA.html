<p>Water softener systems work by removing firmness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the truth that water conditioners use a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener option in locations where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not effectively remove firmness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

When tough water goes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are removed through an ion exchange procedure, so just softened water goes through to your home.

Salt is normally utilized in the regrowth process and brings back the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin once again.</p>
