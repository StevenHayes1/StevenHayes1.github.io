For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water supply. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, because each time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
<p>When the only response to your water heater woes is to replace the whole system, the very best recourse is to upgrade to something that is energy efficient. Such an upgrade conserves you cash over the period of the new unit. The contemporary energy efficient water heaters heat water much faster and are 20% more effective than the older, more traditional models. Many of them use foam insulation rather than the conventional fiberglass.</p>
