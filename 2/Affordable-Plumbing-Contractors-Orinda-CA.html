<p>The drains in the typical home get constant use. Hair, food scraps, soap residue, and other debris can slowly build up gradually. The drain will slowly slow until it ends up being entirely clogged. Chemical drain cleaners offered in stores have restricted efficiency. Although the drain may seem to clear at first, the outcome is often temporary and the clog soon returns. Using these chemicals regularly can cause damage to your plumbing pipes.</p>
