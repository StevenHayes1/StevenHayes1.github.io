<p>Steamfitters and pipefitters, often just called fitters, install and maintain pipes that may bring chemicals, gases, and acids. These pipes are primarily in manufacturing, commercial, and industrial settings. Fitters repair and install pipe systems in power plants, as well as heating and cooling systems in big office buildings. Steamfitters specialize in systems that are designed for the circulation of liquids or gases at high pressure. Other fitters may specialize as sprinklerfitters or gasfitters.</p>
<p>Plumbing is the practice, components and products used in the installation, maintenance, extension, and alteration of all piping, components, plumbing home appliances, and plumbing appurtenances in connection with sanitary drainage or storm drainage centers; venting systems and public or private water supply systems, within or nearby to any building or structure.</p>

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and figure out the reason for the problem. The line was clearly deteriorating; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
