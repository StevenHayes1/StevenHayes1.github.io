Given that gas lines run from your house to the outdoor area of your property if there is a damaged gas line outside of the house you will see damaged plants and condensation on the windows closest to the harmed plumbing.</p>
<p>After showing up after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after among the 2 gentlemen tossed up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and after that put the sink back together but declared they wouldn't take obligation if it leaked now due to the fact that of some undefined oddities in how my sink was created. After they gave me the "don't pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, since I never want to see this company once again.</p>
