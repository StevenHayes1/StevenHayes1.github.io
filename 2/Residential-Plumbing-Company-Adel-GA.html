<h3>Shower Repairs in Adel GA - The Processes Involved</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system needs to be continually kept an eye on. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
