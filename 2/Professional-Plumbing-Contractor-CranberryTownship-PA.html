If your house was constructed before the 1970s, we strongly recommend that you employ a plumbing professional to check your home's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping. Opportunities are that your home might need substantial repiping so that your home's plumbing can function at optimum rates if your home was built years before that.</p>
