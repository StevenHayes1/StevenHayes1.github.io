<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and expect the best is common in our industry and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization effectively interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
