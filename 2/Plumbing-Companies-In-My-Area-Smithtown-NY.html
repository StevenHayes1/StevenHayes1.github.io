<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This triggers fractures in the tubing that can lead to leaks. As these leaks happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to deteriorate. Lastly, chlorinated water has been found to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these concerns.</p>
