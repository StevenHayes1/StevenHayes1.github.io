For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it essential to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that speed up rust Also, there is a lack of clinical evidence supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of deterioration control. Hence, considering all these aspects, in addition to arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that a properly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
