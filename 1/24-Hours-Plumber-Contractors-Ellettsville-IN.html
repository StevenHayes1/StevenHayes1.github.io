<p>When lime is contributed to the water, it changes the water chemistry, causing the calcium to come out of the solution. The particles of calcium combine, end up being heavier than the rest of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins. The clear water then moves into the next action of the treatment process. Flexible gas lines are generally more effective to inflexible lines, particularly in locations where earthquakes are more common and for the connection in between the supply and appliance. Flexible gas lines are less most likely to be disconnected in a natural catastrophe which decreases the danger of an explosion or fire.</p>
