Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom.
