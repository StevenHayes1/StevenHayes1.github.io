<p>Really typically the circular blade inside is stuck. DO NOT REACH INSIDE TO FREE IT! Simply insert a long, tough, wood manage (a broom handle will be sufficient) into the opening. Let it rest against the inside wall, and with force pushing down, turn clockwise until you feel it turn freely. It may be necessary to reset the disposal. If so, locate the reset turn on the bottom of the unit. If the clog persists, utilize any kind of drain cleaner to free it.</p>
