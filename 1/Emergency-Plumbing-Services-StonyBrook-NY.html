<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts should be removed and replaced with brand-new rubber parts. It is necessary that just original factory repair parts are utilized when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was created to use and altering the rubber from the initial factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>When the information collected from the field test shows the assembly has actually degraded in its performance listed below the established minimum standard, backflow preventers ought to only be repaired. The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer fails to meet this minimum standard, the backflow preventer need to be fixed or if necessary, changed. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to weaken in its efficiency, it can still prevent backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specs. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
