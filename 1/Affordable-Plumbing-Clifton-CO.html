<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the culprit. But not constantly. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
