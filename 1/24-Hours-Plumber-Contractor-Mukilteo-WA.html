If your toilet was manufactured before 1994, you could be losing money with every flush. Older toilets consume to 3.5 gallons per flush-- more than double the contemporary standard. A Broken Dip Tube: The dip tube is used to vent all of the fresh water from the water line to the bottom of your tank so that it can warm much faster. If you find that cold water is coming out of your faucet even when you are turning the hot knob, it is most likely that your dip tube is broken.</p>
<p>Be aware that softened water contains trace quantities of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water consists of about the exact same quantity of salt as a piece of bread. That's not very much salt, but for those on a stringent sodium-free diet plan it may be excessive. If this does not work, you may need to replace among your toilet's elements, generally the flapper. There might likewise be a problem with the chain connected to the float or the flapper ball. A plumber can easily replace these parts.</p>
