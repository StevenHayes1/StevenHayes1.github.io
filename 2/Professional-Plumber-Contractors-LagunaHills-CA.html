<p>I had a significant sewer problem with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I actually got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a price quote. They right away cleared the preliminary obstruction, permitting the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary concern and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
