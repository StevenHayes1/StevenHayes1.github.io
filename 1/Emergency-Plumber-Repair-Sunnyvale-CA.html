<p>A lot of houses or structures that were constructed in the 1970s normally have galvanized piping. Over time, the plumbing system can wear and the pipes can begin to corrode. This can trigger low water pressure and affect the hot water within the plumbing system.

As the external coating of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
