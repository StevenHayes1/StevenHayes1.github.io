<p>She learnt about the service call charge. The 4 On Your Side Investigation discovered that's a common fee. Customer Investigator Jodi Brooks called around to try to get a price quote from private plumbers for a waste disposal unit replacement. None of the businesses we called would give an estimate over the phone. All of them wanted to look at the circumstance before devoting to a rate, and all wanted to charge a service charge to come out. Brooks found just one plumber who would come out without charging.</p>
<p>The Final Jeopardy response, you ask? The device that controls water circulation in your toilet. You'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve if you look behind your toilet. This is how water enters your toilet. After you flush the toilet, the fill valve opens to fill up the water in the tank and the toilet bowl, preparing the system for the next flush. If your fill valve is broken, not set at the correct level, or isn't set up properly, you might experience a regularly or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you numerous dollars in wasted water.</p>

<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system must be continually kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
