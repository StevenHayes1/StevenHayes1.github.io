<p>A variety of companies, such as the American Water Functions Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) offer accreditation courses created to train specialists to evaluate backflow preventers. Requirements for training differ by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not needed to become certified.</p>
<p>Responsibility for installation falls upon the owner of the home or the co-op or apartment board. Owners and boards of buildings that are issued an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer need to submit plans with the DEP within thirty days. If the DEP has actually not received accreditation from a PE, RA, or LMP that the backflow preventer is at least in the process of being installed within that time, a Notice of Infraction will be sent. Lawbreakers will be liable for a civil charge of up to $1,000 issued by the Environmental Control Board (ECB).
