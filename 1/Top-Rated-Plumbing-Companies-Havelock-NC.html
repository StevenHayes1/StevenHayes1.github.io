<p>Take the example of the immediate hot shower that uses the point-of-use hot water heater; these appliances will provide warm water constantly for the duration you are using the shower. They will stop to work only if there are power concerns or if the hot water heater is faulty. In essence, it heats the water on demand with simply the amount you need, hence removing the loss sustained with the use of storage tank water heaters where the water cools and is then reheated.</p>
