<h3>Why A Water Leak Detection System Is Important For Your Home in Pottstown PA</h3>
<p>Corrosion is an intricate phenomenon and there are lots of factors that accelerate rust in the drinking-water distribution system and property plumbing. For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it crucial to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any elements that speed up deterioration Likewise, there is an absence of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient form of deterioration control. Hence, considering all these elements, as well as results from research study studies, WQA's position is that a properly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>
