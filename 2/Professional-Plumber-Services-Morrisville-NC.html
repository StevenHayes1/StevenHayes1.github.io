<p>Polybutylene used inside your home can be discovered near the hot water heater or coming out of the walls to feed toilets or sinks. Caution: some plumbers installed stub outs" of copper when leaving the wall. Because copper is revealing does not mean you do not have polybutylene pipes, simply. You might need to make a small hole in the drywall to see the connection.</p>
<p>If you get your water from a neighborhood water supply, check to see if your community already softens the water.

Throughout regrowth, salty water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salty water cleans the mineral deposits off the resin beads.
