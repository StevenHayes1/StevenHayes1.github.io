Rather than a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capability. During durations of low flow demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
