When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to press the waste out of your drain system. Existing policies limit the amount of water a toilet can utilize per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave debris piling up in cast iron drain lines.

If this does not work, you might need to replace among your toilet's components, normally the flapper. There might likewise be an issue with the chain connected to the float or the flapper ball. A plumber can quickly replace these parts.</p>
