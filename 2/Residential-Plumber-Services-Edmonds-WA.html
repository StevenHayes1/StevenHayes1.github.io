Plumb Crazy Plumbing offers a standard thirty days guarantee on repairs, drain cleaning and 1 year service warranty on replacement plumbing tasks.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Price Busters replace a hot water heater tank and a main water turned off valve. They were prompt and very responsive to send me a bid which was really competitive. They were really professional and did an awesome task. I would absolutely call them once again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration just appears when warm water is being utilized, then the rust most likely exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is of course still an issue that needs to be handled immediately (you'll likely need a new hot water heater) however not one that needs repiping.</p>
