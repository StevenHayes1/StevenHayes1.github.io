Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or even jeopardize the structural stability of the house.</p>
<p>The majority of softeners have a bypass constructed into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you need to provide some kind of maintenance to it or even while you're dealing with installing it.
