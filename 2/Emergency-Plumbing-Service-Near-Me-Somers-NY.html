<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the tough water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Because opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the tough water goes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is released. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it passes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
