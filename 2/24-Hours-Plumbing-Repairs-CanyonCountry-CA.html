<p>Water softener systems work by getting rid of solidity minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from developing by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of solidity from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
