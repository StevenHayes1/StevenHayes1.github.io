So working with a licensed, insured master plumber (or a trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. However not all plumbers deal with all types of work. Their duties break out into two classifications: Plumbers who deal with standard repairs (typically in emergency situations), and plumbers who specialize in remodeling additions and jobs.</p>
<p>The simplest option might appear to be just overlooking the issue or using a do it yourself chemical solution. However, this is a short-term fix and might trigger more damage. Some pipe products, like copper or cast-iron, are delicate to chemicals. Chemical cleaners can wear away and deteriorate your pipes, causing significant leaks, cracks, and big damages.</p>
