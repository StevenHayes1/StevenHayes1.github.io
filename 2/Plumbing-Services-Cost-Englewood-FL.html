<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on.
