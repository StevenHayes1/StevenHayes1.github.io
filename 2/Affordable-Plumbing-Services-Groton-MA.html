<p>Water softeners are home appliances linked to your home's water supply that eliminate the minerals like calcium and magnesium that cause water hardness. Water softening equipment can be quickly eliminated, so you can take it with you if you move.

How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them changed immediately. Prior to you can request an inspection, you should first obtain the needed permit( s) for the work you mean to do. You can check out our Authorization page to find out more on getting a license.

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health danger for people on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of salt in water, in order to decrease its mineral material. Generally, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how difficult the water was to begin with. More difficult water will result in more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in sodium is small, however if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a stringent low salt diet plan this increase can posture problems.</p>
