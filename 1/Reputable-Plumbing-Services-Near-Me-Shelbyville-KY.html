Water pressure might stop working or be reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for instance, when several fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may permit infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
