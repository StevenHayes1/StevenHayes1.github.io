<h3>How To Keep Bathroom Sinks Running Smoothly in Lincoln RI</h3>
<p>We carry the full range of Backflow prevention choices. So which should you use? The plumbers at Clarke & Rush are professionals in repipe jobs, and qualified to help you make this important decision. We will ensure you understand your choices, the benefits and drawbacks, and make a suggestion so you can make an educated choice. A waste disposal unit typically plugs into a 120-volt GFCI (ground-fault circuit interruptor) outlet under the sink. If an outlet like this isn't readily available under your sink, you'll need to have an electrician install one.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. The majority of home centers bring only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" design, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
