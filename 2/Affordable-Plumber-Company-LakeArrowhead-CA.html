<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler typically are installed in locations where water might trigger devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized.

<p>When deciding on the appropriate system defense there are numerous considerations we need to take a look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all scenarios in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation needs to be taken a look at on a private basis as an unique stand-alone system. The National Fire Security Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of lawn sprinkler contains the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire protection system are created to match the hazard that exists in the areas they are set up in. As building types and contents of these structures can be very different, we need to comprehend that the fire protection system for any installation requires to be designed and set up to satisfy that specific threat or need. An aircraft hangar will need a very various fire security system than the system needed in an apartment. The backflow defense requirements for these two examples would also differ significantly.</p>
