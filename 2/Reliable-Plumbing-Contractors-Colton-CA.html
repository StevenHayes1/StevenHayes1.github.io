<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually frequently been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to customer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening merely removes firmness minerals and gets rid of problems that are an annoyance and not a danger to human health.
