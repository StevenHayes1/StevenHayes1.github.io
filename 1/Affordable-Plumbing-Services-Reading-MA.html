The product has extremely developed structure of pores on the surface of which are sites with easily trapped and released ions. This process of trapping of ions occurs with a synchronised releasing of other ions resulting in the term ion-exchange. Ion exchange resins can be made to selectively prefer one, or possibly numerous different kinds of ions. Usually, these resins are based upon cross-linked polystyrene.</p>
