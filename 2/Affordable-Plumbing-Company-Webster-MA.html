Calcium, magnesium and lots of other minerals carry positive charges, so water softeners utilize salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with drinkable water, you are needed to have 2 backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, potable and watering, you are also needed to have two backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>

<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor Webster MA</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer might be required to be found on the water service line, within the structure, or both locations. After an initial inspection and testing of a recently installed backflow preventer, the water client is required to have the backflow preventer evaluated on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>A new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of used thin pipe and the painting the inside of the used pipe with epoxy paint. Often during the sandblasting the sandblasting will wear thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. Some of those thin spots leak immediately and in some cases those leakages come days or weeks later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated wind up requiring to be correctly re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
