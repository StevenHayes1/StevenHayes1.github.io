<p>If there is no grounded outlet present to power the garbage disposal, you may need to pay for the installation of electrical wiring. The cost of materials for a grounded outlet will likely cost between $5 and $10, and $120 to $165 to employ an electrical expert If your installation requires a new switch, expect to invest an additional $5 to $10 on materials, and $50 for labor.</p>
