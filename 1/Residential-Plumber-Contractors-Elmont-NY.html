<p>When completion user opens a valve (faucet, sprinkler, etc), water flows in the normal instructions from the provider, downstream to fill the user's need. The circulation of water pushes the spring-loaded check valves open. The tension of the # 1 check spring maintainins the pressure difference in the Zone of Reduced Pressure. This difference in pressure keeps the relief valve in the closed position while water streams in the typical instructions.</p>
