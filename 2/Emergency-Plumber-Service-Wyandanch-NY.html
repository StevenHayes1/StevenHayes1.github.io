<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab.

Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in specific communities, based on our experience.</p>
