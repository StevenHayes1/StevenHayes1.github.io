<p>Throughout normal operation, the pressure in between the 2 check valves, described as the zone of reduced pressure, is maintained at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. The relief valve is designed to release and open water to the outside if either check valve must leak. An RPZ will regularly discharge percentages of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this reason, the RPZ should be installed in areas that are exempt to water damage and allow sufficient drainage.</p>
