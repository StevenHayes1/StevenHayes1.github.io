I really got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a quote. They right away cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon additional investigation, there was a substantial clog that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
