<p>Maintenance is another consideration. While you can purchase models with special features that do whatever but include the salt, you will spend for each additional feature.

Depending upon the water source, you might need to filter turbid water or disinfect bacteria-laden water-all before it even reaches the softening system. Finally, if you own a septic tank, you should think about the extra load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates suggest that about 50 gallons of water are utilized for each regeneration cycle. This may or may not trigger hydraulic overload of the septic tank.</p>

Under the provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1971, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recognized nationwide standards for safe drinking water.
