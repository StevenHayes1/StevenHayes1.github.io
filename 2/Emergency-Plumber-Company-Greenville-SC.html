<p>Backflow preventers are critical for creating a safe water supply system. No matter which design you select, all water softeners need to be correctly preserved. The salt water solution must be blended and stored in the brine tank. Periodic obstructing of the resin likewise requires special attention. For example, if the raw water supply is turbid it may clog the resin with mud and clay. Sometimes, regular backwashing with water will solve this problem. If not, gradually stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help break up the material. Also, fungi and bacteria also form mats in the resin that minimize its effectiveness. Sanitizing the water prior to softening or regularly cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will eliminate these nuisances. Nevertheless, check out the maker's guidelines before including any chemicals to the system.</p>

Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully created and installed to avoid backflow.
