That odor might be originating from your sewer system, which requires repair right now. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that gets rid of sewage from your house, releases sewer gas, and controls atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has actually failed, it will frequently need to be replaced rather than fixed.
