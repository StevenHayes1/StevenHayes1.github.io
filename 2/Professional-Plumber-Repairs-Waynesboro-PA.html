<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to manage peak circulation rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your service' circulation rates throughout the day. Throughout durations of high circulation demand, tanks come on-line to include circulation rate capability. Throughout periods of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive flow innovation, and it's perhaps the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
