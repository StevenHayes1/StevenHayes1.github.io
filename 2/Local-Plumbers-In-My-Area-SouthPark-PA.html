<h3>Safe Alternatives In Fixing A Blocked Drain in SouthPark PA</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to operate, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system should be continuously kept an eye on. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends out an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm system that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both approaches. NFPA 13 refers to all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
