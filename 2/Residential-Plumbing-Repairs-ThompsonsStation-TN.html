<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors ThompsonsStation TN</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned up quickly and efficiently with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, giving off from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove particles such as tough water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
