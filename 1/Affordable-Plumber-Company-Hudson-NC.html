I really received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They instantly cleared the preliminary obstruction, allowing for the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
