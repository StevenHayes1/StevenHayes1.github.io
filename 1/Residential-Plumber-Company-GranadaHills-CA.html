For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it certainly does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by discussing all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
