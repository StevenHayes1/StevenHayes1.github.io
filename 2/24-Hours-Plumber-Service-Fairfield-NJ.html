It's prevalent for a toilet to have broken parts at some time which triggers the toilet to run. What they mean is the toilet will not stop running when someone states a toilet is running.

Lead, as you understand, no matter how helpful, is an environmental toxin (note the need for unleaded gas and paint in homes that is not lead based). You might not want to live in a home that has lead pipes if you have kids.</p>
