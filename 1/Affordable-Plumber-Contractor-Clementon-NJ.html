<p>While lots of hot water heater problems can be efficiently repaired, some problems will require total hot water heater replacement. If your water heater is past its regular lifespan (generally anywhere from 8 to ten years or longer if you have a tankless water heater) or if it has a major leak or comprehensive rust, it might be time to consider replacement.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might have to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug package that I purchased separately from the disposal unit. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cable through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the system with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Although these homeowners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline before the problem got worse. Waiting simply wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a very expensive choice.</p>
