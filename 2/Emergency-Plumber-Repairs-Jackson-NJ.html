<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc developed and constructed a smaller model that operated on the very same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc likewise developed a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and municipal sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was stopped in 1973.</p>
