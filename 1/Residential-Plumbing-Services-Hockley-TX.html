<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and wish for the very best is common in our industry and many companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the firmness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under extreme temperatures. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
