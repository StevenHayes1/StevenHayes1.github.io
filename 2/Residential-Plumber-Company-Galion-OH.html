I in fact got their number for another company that could not come soon enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary blockage, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further investigation, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to investigate. His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
