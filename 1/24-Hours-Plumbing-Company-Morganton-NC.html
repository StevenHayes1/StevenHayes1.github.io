<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Morganton NC</h3>
<p>Wax ring replacement and seating toilet to flange. The cost of a plumber differs by the area of the United States you live in. A plumber may cost less in a backwoods than in a metropolitan area; however on average, a plumber will charge a fixed charge in the variety of $130-$ 310 to fix a toilet. Location a towel beneath the fuel lines to avoid gas leakages from forming.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. Many home centers carry only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
<p>In general, toilets are pretty easy to repair and operate.

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and figure out the cause of the problem. The line was clearly deteriorating; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
