The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Requirement for the installation of sprinkler systems contains the requirement for the sprinkler systems themselves. Fire protection system are developed to match the hazard that exists in the locations they are set up in. As structure types and contents of these structures can be extremely various, we need to comprehend that the fire protection system for any installation needs to be designed and installed to satisfy that particular threat or need.

<h3>Why Do You Need a Drain Cleaning Service at Chesapeake VA?</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system needs to be continually kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both methods. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory devices.</p>
