<p>Softeners mainly eliminate calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are typically referred to as 'solidity minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they must be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a substantial warning that something more major is wrong with them.</p>
<p>Hydro-jetting is an efficient method to totally clear your main sewer line. Many people typically refer to rooting as drain cleaning, nevertheless, this is not completely accurate. Rootering a line with a drain machine breaks through a blockage triggering a backup. Hydro-jetting is a different type of service to entirely clean the drain line.</p>
