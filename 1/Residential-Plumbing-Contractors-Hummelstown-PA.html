<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Hummelstown PA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak circulation rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to efficiently adjust to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. During durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
