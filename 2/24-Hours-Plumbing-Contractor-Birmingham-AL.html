<p>For gas lines that should be run under ground, an unique kind of black pipe need to be used that is covered with a special plastic material that keeps the wetness out. This is so it is easily noticeable from underground water lines, and likewise since the plastic finish in fact protects the pipe much better than a galvanized coating would.</p>
