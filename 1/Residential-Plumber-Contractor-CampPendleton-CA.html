Gather your family and move them out, then contact us to alert the gas company what has happened. Next, call your local plumbing professional so they can come, check the line, and see if repair or replacement is essential. A reputable company like Gene Johnson Plumbing & Heating can supply gas line installation to replace the broken pipe.</p>
