<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line clogs are not something a property owner can fix. This type of clog needs a professional plumber or drain professional to use a drain cleaning machine to find the clog and get it cleared. TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and find the clog or break in the line.

The Pipe Pull strategy interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the use of a small hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the brand-new piping into location. All new replacement pipes have actually a forecasted life expectancy of one hundred years and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another efficient method is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically gets rid of the need for broken pipe elimination. By inserting a hardening lining product which coats the inside of the existing pipe, a new pipe is created inside the broken one.</p>
