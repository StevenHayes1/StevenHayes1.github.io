<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler usually are installed in locations where water could trigger catastrophic damage, such as in freezers, computer spaces, and locations with electronic devices. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system.

Points at which a safe and clean water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow.
