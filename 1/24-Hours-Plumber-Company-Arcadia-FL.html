<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I could discover on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me an estimate. They right away cleared the preliminary clog, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more investigation, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to examine. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a 3rd time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
