After they gave me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was wrapped around the plumbing.

After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to inspect the line and identify the reason for the problem.

Even worse, the line might collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
