<p>Pre-action lawn sprinkler typically are installed in areas where water could trigger disastrous damage, such as in freezers, computer system rooms, and areas with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system contains air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>

<p>The simplest mechanical backflow prevention device is the vacuum breaker assembly (VBA). It has one moving part, a portable disc connected to a climatic vent.

<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey rate entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
