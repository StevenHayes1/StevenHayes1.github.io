Our extensive water quality program operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to guarantee that the water provided to our customers is kept free from damaging pollutants. A fundamental part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to devices consisting of a nonpotable substance, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination may take place when water streams through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating & cooling system, into the safe and clean water supply. This can occur through a process referred to as backflow.</p>

I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, considering that I never want to see this company again.</p>
