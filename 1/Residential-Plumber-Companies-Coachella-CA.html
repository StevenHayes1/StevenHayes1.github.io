So employing a licensed, insured master plumber (or a well-trained apprentice working under his license) is a no-brainer. But not all plumbers handle all kinds of work. Their duties break out into 2 categories: Plumbers who handle fundamental repairs (frequently in emergency situations), and plumbers who focus on renovating jobs and additions.</p>

We'll find any problems and develop the solutions you need.
