<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets ought to absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing. That toilet should be replaced if you can move a toilet around by doing anything less intense than swinging a sledgehammer at it. Improperly seated and sealed toilets might leak, damage plumbing, and even jeopardize the structural integrity of the home.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. The majority of home centers bring only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet.
