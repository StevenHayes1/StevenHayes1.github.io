<p>Rust: The most common issue is deterioration in the tank and pipes that link to your hot water heater. This is particularly real if you have unattended difficult water, which contains extreme minerals that can attach to the piping and tank and break down the material over time. Whether it's calcium, iron, or another component that is triggering the corrosion, you will ultimately experience a leak in your water heater that is difficult to repair. Leakages frequently suggest a new unit replacement remains in order.</p>
<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water passes through the resin, the beads grab ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
