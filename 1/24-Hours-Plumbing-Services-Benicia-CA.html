<h3>How To Repair A Leaking Kitchen Faucet at Benicia CA</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
