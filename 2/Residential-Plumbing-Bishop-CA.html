<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, usually made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, indicating they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges attract, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the hardness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
