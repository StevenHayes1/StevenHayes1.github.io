Water pressure might be or stop working minimized when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe might enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>

It is essential to get out in front of any problems as fast as possible. The quicker you respond to a concern, the better chance you'll have to conserve time and money on water heater services.</p>
