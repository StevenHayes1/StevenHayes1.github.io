No matter what kind of hot water heater you have or have an interest in, the professionals at Timothy Off can assist. Contact us today for our hot water heater installation services. For instance, if your kitchen sink is supported because you flushed potato peels down the disposal, a quick drain snaking can separate the blockage and send it down the pipes.

<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow direction within a piping system that is brought on by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of normal circulation in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is reduced main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>

<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
