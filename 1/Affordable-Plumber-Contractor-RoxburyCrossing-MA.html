<h3>Outdoor Faucet Repair in RoxburyCrossing Massachusetts</h2>
<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are home appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. Once the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride solution becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>With all the house water purification systems - consisting of salt-free residential water softeners - that are on the market, how do you decide what is right for your house? Make certain to compare water softeners based upon your home's water and your family's water use. A licensed EcoWater Pro can diagnose your water and recommend the best option for your house.</p>

<p>Reach for a common household plunger if these mixes aren't successful in unclogging your sink. First seal off the second side with a damp cloth or a stopper if you have a double sink. You'll need to develop a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you plan to plunge with sufficient water to cover the bell of the plunger.

<p>Hydro jetting is a process in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at approximately 3,500 PSI. This allows the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, releasing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, move the hose through the line to eliminate particles such as hard water scale, sand, grease, and silt deposits.</p>
