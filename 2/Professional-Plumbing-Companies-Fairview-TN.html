<p>Leakages are sly. Drains clog with time. In kitchens, greases, soaps and more develop on the walls of the pipes and cause a blockage. In bathrooms, showers, tubs and sinks become clogged with hair and soap, and toilets can become clogged with toilet paper. When this occurs, you need the aid of a plumber experienced in drain cleaning. While there are items on the market that offer a do-it-yourself solution, these often use just a momentary fix and can cause larger problems later on.

In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can significantly restrict the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>
