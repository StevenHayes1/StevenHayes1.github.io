Versatile gas lines are typically more suitable to inflexible lines, particularly in locations where earthquakes are more typical and for the connection between the supply and home appliance. Versatile gas lines are less most likely to be detached in a natural catastrophe which decreases the risk of an explosion or fire.</p>
