Backsiphonage takes place when there is an unfavorable pressure in the water distribution system, which draws the water from a personal water system into the public water supply. This can take place at any time, such as during a water main break or throughout a large firefighting effort.</p>
<p>In many cases, an absence of hot water is caused by a defective breaker or a broken high-temperature cutoff switch. If the water is lukewarm, the dip tube inside the tank may be cracked. Scalding water is typically the result of a broken pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water is dangerous and ought to be immediately addressed by an experienced plumbing professional.</p>
