<p>When lime is added to the water, it alters the water chemistry, causing the calcium to come out of the solution. The particles of calcium integrate, end up being heavier than the remainder of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins. The clear water then moves into the next step of the treatment process. Versatile gas lines are typically preferable to inflexible lines, particularly in locations where earthquakes are more typical and for the connection between the supply and appliance. Flexible gas lines are less likely to be disconnected in a natural disaster which decreases the risk of an explosion or fire.</p>

<p>The next step we must carry out in the repair process, is to flush the incoming water line. After we have cleaned the body, and the fixed components are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or debris. This can be difficult, particularly when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around.
