<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service SaintAugustine FL</h3>
<p>Water isn't hot enough. This can be aggravating because you might bear with it for weeks or even months before choosing it needs to be fixed. Thankfully it's typically a quick, simple fix. We see this a lot on standard electrical water heaters, which utilize a pair of electrical heating elements to warm the tank. Often, among the two burns out, leading to water that's warm but not hot. We can replace it or detect the real problem if this isn't it.</p>
<p>To identify if your house is a poly house," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are usually blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in size. Regularly, it goes into the home near the water heater. Your main shut down is connected to the end of the water pipe. Ensure you check both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
