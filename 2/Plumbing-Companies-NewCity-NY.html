<p>Many plumbers will get rid of the old system to install the brand-new one at the exact same hourly rate. This can increase the amount of time required to install the new unit, for that reason increasing expenses. This truly depends upon what condition the rest of the pipes remain in, and how difficult the old system is to remove. In many cases, removal will only add an additional $25 to $50 to the overall costs, however in some cases the expenses might be higher if additional pipes should also be changed.</p>

If setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would counteract the pressure loss, a PE or RA can help identify.</p>
