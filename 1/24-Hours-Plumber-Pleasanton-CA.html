<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed effective, Sam Blanc designed and constructed a smaller design that ran on the exact same concept but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains in addition to laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also built a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and municipal sewer pipes. An improved version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable. It was ceased in 1973.</p>
