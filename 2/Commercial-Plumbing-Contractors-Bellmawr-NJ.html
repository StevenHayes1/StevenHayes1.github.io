<p>Similar to other building employees, work of pipefitters, plumbers, and steamfitters is sensitive to variations in the economy. On the one hand, workers may experience periods of unemployment when the general level of construction falls. On the other hand, scarcities of employees may happen in some areas during peak periods of structure activity.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might need to attach a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cord with a plug package that I purchased individually from the disposal unit. It's as simple as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
