<p>Backflow threatens since it can pollute the public drinking supply with contaminants like fertilizers, pesticides, human waste, and harmful chemicals.

<p>Though water line replacement sounds like your house's equivalent of major surgical treatment, it's really something we at Gotelli Plumbing deal with frequently. When your water lines are repiped, it simply means old copper and galvanized pipes are replaced with new pipes. We find that homes 15 years or older who have never had repiping work are the most likely candidates for water line replacement. You might be in need of water line repiping if you have an older house and are experiencing significant and regular leaks. If you do have frequent leaks, we find that repiping can really be the cheaper and better long-lasting solution.</p>
