No, it is not a frequent occurrence, but it does happen regularly than you think! Typically it takes place during the night when you do not observe the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a pipes, or link a brand-new pipe. This makes construction jobs easily the most common reason for backflow problems. Fire battling is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks use substantial pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding locations to drop, and backflow will take place in the surrounding communities.</p>
