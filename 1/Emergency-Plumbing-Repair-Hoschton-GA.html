If either of these disadvantages are unacceptable to you - you'll wish to discover what's called a non-precipitating water softener. Turn on the water to fill the toilet tank. Pinch the spring clip and slide the float up or down to set the water level 1 in. below the top of the overflow tube or to the water line marked on the tank.</p>

<p>Another downside of water softening through ion exchange is the prospective health threat for people on low sodium diet plans. Ion exchange increases the amount of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral material. Typically, this process adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending on how tough the water was to begin with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is small, but if you have actually been encouraged by a doctor to follow a stringent low salt diet this increase can present problems.</p>
