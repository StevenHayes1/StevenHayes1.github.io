<p>Water softeners can be found in all sizes and shapes and bigger absolutely does not suggest much better. WaterBoss ® uses fine mesh resin - smaller sized beads that actually offer more area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to enable maximum capability in a minimum of space. Plus, our patented Directional Flow Screen system assists make sure that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter also protect the resin bed, so we do not need to waste space on freeboard" which is the empty area in traditional water softeners that permit a churning of resin throughout regrowth to release dirt, sediment and firmness.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, however, the beads reach maximum capability and can't attract anymore mineral ions. At that point, the softener tank must be regenerated, or, flushed clean. That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer system determines the amount of water that streams through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth immediately starts. For a three-bedroom house and family of four, regrowth usually happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
