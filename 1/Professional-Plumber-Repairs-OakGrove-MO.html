<p>The most efficient method to resolve difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>All backflow preventers should be evaluated each year and after repair, moving, or replacement by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester (BAT). A copy of the test report should be supplied to the City of Bellingham. Most of the tankless heaters included a maker service warranty ranging from 10 to 15 years.
