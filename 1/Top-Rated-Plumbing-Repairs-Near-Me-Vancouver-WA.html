<h3>Emergency Plumber & 24 Hour Plumbing Services Vancouver WA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has actually been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation need, tanks come on-line to add circulation rate capability. Throughout durations of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new approach to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
