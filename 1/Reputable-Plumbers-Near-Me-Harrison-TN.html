<p>Difficult water causes a higher threat of lime scale deposits in household water systems. Due to this lime scale build-up, pipes are blocked and the performance of hot boilers and tanks is reduced. This increases the cost of domestic water heating by about fifteen to twenty percent. Dark Blue = Supply-side pressure (for instance, 100 psi) presses versus the # 1 check and likewise fills the area on the "high pressure" side of the Relief Valve diaphram, pressing it closed.</p>
<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the equation! To just pour some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is common in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the market. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperature levels. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can achieve this.</p>
