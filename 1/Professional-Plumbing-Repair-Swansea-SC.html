<p>IRWD is devoted to delivering safe, high quality water to customers. Our extensive water quality program operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, to make sure that the water provided to our consumers is kept devoid of damaging impurities. A vital part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is linked to devices including a nonpotable compound, this is known as a cross-connection. Contamination might occur when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a lawn sprinkler or heating and cooling system, into the drinkable water supply. This can take place through a process known as backflow.</p>
<p>Most softeners have a bypass built into the outlet and the inlet. By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to supply some type of maintenance to it or even while you're dealing with installing it.
