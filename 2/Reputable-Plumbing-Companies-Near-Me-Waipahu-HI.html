Prolonged guarantee: Most disposals feature at least a 1-year service warranty, however if you purchase one with a life time guarantee (15+ years), it will most likely be more pricey. While there's not an exact schedule as to when you must repipe your home, you ought to definitely look into repiping if they haven't been carried out in 50 years or more-- especially if you reside in an older home built closer to the turn of the last century.</p>
<p>Garbage disposal warranties last approximately 5 years, but they can vary in between 2 and ten years. Considering that the average life expectancy of a garbage disposal is 12 years, you may wish to buy an extended service warranty. Many guarantees cover the cost to repair and replace typical wear and tear failures. To prevent further breakdowns, house owners should keep up with routine maintenance of their garbage disposal.</p>
