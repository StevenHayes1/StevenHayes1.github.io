<p>So what should you do as a property owner? Firstly, do not try to take on the job of repairing the sink yourself. Work with a professional plumber to handle the task of your sink repair if you want to avoid considerable water line damage. If it is a split sink, leaky pipe or clogged drain, the danger of making the sink problem worse and causing extra damage is pretty high. Do you really wish to pay the cost?

<p>It may be time to get it changed if your water heater has required several repairs over the last few years. An excellent rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the life expectancy of the typical hot water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. If the cost of a repair is majority the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater.</p>
