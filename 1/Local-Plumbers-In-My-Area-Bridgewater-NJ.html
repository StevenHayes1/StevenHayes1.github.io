<p>You live in an older home. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done quickly. Galvanized pipes were most often set up in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to burst and wear away when they get old. You might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one if so. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
