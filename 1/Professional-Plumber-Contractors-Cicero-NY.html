<p>The water quality improvement industry has earnestly sought to sort out the factual information on water softener system effluent. When water softening waste water is discharged into correctly set up personal septic systems, a current septic tank study from the Water Quality Association plainly indicates that there are no adverse results. There are several extra reports that also explain more evidence of the solidity ions in a softener's regeneration waste triggering less clogging and preserving higher permeability than the regular sewage-disposal tank effluent.</p>
