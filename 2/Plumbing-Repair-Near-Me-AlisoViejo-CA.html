Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
