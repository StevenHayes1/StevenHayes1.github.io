<p>Corrosion is a complex phenomenon and there are many elements that accelerate deterioration in the drinking-water distribution system and property plumbing. For many years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; nevertheless, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that accelerate deterioration Likewise, there is an absence of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable type of corrosion control. Thus, thinking about all these factors, in addition to results from research studies, WQA's position is that a correctly set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
