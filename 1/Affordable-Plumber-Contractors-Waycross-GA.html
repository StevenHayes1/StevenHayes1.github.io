<p>The majority of houses or buildings that were constructed in the 1970s generally have galvanized piping. With time, the plumbing system can wear out and the pipes can start to corrode. This can cause low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to provide weather security. As the external finishing of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and moisture, triggering the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>You reside in an older house. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never ever changed its pipes, there's a great chance that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were most often installed in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to burst and rust when they get old. If so, you might need to add a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not already have one. This typically adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
