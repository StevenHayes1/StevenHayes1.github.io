<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually typically been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning procedure. This is due largely to overstated advertising and, in part, to consumer mistaken beliefs about water treatment.

The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not need. However, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this choice a considerable one.</p>
