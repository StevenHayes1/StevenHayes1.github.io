<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in LakeButler FL?</h3>
<p>From showers and tubs clogged with hair and soap accumulation to sinks filled with tooth paste and other gunk, restrooms present numerous challenges when it pertains to keeping drains clear and free. Even toilets can be overwhelmed with toilet paper or non-flushable materials. Regardless of the difficulty, Roto-Rooter plumbers have all the devices needed to address clogged bathroom drains and can supply skilled sewer cleaning and drain cleaning services.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of house centers carry only one or 2 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. If there's a door near the toilet, also determine how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>
