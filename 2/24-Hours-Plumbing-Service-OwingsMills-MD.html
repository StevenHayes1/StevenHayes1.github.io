While water overuse is a problem for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can use up to 25 gallons of water every day for their regeneration procedure. That's 700 gallons of water a month just to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>The HydroFLOW water conditioner keeps minerals, algae, and bacteria from becoming a problem in your water supply by sending an electrical signal of 150 kilohertz (kHz) through your plumbing system. The signal causes the minerals to collaborate, forming clusters that ultimately form stable crystals. These crystals do not cling to surfaces like private minerals would.</p>
