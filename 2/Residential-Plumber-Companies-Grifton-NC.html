<p>On average, it will cost from $45 to $197 to repair a toilet yourself or in between $130 and $310 to have actually professional repairs done by a plumber.

<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have a negative charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges draw in, the negative charge of the minerals is brought in to the favorable charge of the resin beads. As the hard water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water drains into your home.</p>
