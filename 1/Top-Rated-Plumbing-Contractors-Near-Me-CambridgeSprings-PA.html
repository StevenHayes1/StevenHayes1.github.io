<p>Water hardness is the amount of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. The factor you can feel the difference on your skin is due to the fact that soap reacts with the calcium to form soap residue. This results in the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean.
