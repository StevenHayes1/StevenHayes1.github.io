<h3>What Do I Do If a Faucet Leaks in Dover PA?</h3>
<p>Low hot water pressure? Our knowledgeable plumbers can determine and resolve your low water pressure issue. Signs of corrosion or scale buildup on components might suggest past leakages and high pressure. This can lead plumbers to examine if there is a larger issue needing attention. Dealing with gas is very hazardous, and it is important to shut off the line to allow for a safe repair process.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in.. The majority of home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
