The test procedure is a diagnostic assessment of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer should be repaired or if required, changed.

The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specs. This implies the assembly is fixed so that it can carry out above the minimum standard.</p>
