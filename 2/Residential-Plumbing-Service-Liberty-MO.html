<p>Woodbury's water hardness is roughly 13.5 grains. More extreme cross-connection hazards might need an unique type of backflow preventer that can automatically release potentially polluted water before it enters the public water system. Given that they must be set up above ground, Reduced Pressure Zone (RPZ) assemblies are furnished in turn-key aluminum enclosures that supply security versus vandalism and freezing. Available in various colors.</p>
<p>A water softener works by using electrical charges to eliminate the minerals. Calcium, magnesium and numerous other minerals carry favorable charges, so water softeners utilize salt ions, which are "exchanged" with the calcium and magnesium ions. If you irrigate with safe and clean water, you are needed to have two backflow preventers, one at the meter and another one on the watering line at the point of connection. If you have 2 meters, safe and clean and irrigation, you are likewise required to have 2 backflow preventers, one at each meter.</p>
