<h3>No Hot Water - No Problem, Fix Yourself in Middlebury IN!</h3>
<p>What is hard water? Scientifically speaking, it is water that contains substantial amounts of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water takes a trip through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a lot of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite an annoyance-- for its numerous intended uses around your house.</p>

If your hot water heater isn't working, our skilled group of technicians at Kramer and Sons is prepared to supply you with top-notch, same-day service.</p>
