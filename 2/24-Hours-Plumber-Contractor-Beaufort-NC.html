The water inside this tank is heated up and then launched into the pipes of your house through a hot-water pipe on top of the tank. Another pipe that emerges from the tank includes the temperature level and pressure-relief valve, which opens if you exceed a pre-programmed level. You'll also find a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control system outside for setting temperature levels and controlling the pilot-light valve.</p>
