<p>If you need a water softener is a personal choice, identifying. A permit is not required for repairs which include just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions offered modifications are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A common water softener consists of a tall, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, broad brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a close-by drainpipe or drywell.</p>

Water conditioners do not effectively remove firmness from the water supply, however, as the only method to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
