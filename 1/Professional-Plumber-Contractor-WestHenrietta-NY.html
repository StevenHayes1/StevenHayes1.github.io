<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Technology (HVLD) testing procedure includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made from a non-conductive material. Some disposer systems do not featured a power cord attached. Remove the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical wiring (Image 1) if this is the case. Be sure to purchase a wiring set with the correct power score and hardware for your disposer unit (Images 2 and 3). Make sure the cord is long enough to reach the receptacle without extending the cable when you connect the circuitry harness to the disposer.</p>
<p>Step 6: To link the drain, place the gasket in the discharge outlet. Then attach the discharge tube with the flange and bolts. Now hang the disposal by aligning the three tabs with the mounting ring. Use the included wrench to turn and lock the tabs over the ridges. Then connect the dishwasher drain. Make certain the discharge pipe is lined up properly and link your drains-- use a T-pipe prior to your P-trap.</p>
