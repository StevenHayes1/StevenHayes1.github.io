<h3>Looking For A Plumber In NewPortRichey FL</h3>
<p>Reach for a common household plunger if these combinations aren't successful in unclogging your sink. If you have a double sink, first seal the second side with a damp cloth or a stopper. You'll need to produce a tight seal around the plunger, so fill the side of the sink you plan to plunge with enough water to cover the bell of the plunger. Location the plunger strongly over the drain and plunge intensely a number of times. When you hear the suction clear the clog, eliminate the plunger and flush the drain well with warm water.</p>
