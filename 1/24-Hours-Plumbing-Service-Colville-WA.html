<p>Water temperature issues can be repaired by changing the temperature level on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet may be triggered by a blocked aerator screen. House owners can just loosen the aerator screen from the faucet to clean out minerals or other deposits. If the shutoff valves under the sink are not open all the method, water pressure can also be low.</p>
