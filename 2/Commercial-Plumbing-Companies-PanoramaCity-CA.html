<p>Rust is an intricate phenomenon and there are many aspects that accelerate corrosion in the drinking-water distribution system and facility plumbing. For many years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and corrosion, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that speed up deterioration Also, there is an absence of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an efficient kind of corrosion control.
