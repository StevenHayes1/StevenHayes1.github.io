<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers Wilkesboro NC</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better option to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand name is experiencing a great deal of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leakages occur, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to deteriorate. Finally, chlorinated water has been found to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these concerns.</p>
<p>Yes, anywhere connections are or can be made in between the drinkable supply of water and non-potable water or compounds a backflow assembly is required to be set up.

<p>Although these house owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was certainly excellent timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline before the issue got worse. Waiting simply wasn't a choice. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a detached garage. At the least, it would have been a very costly choice.</p>
