<p>Cold showers? High energy bills? It might be time for a new hot water heater. However in order to profit of a new energy-efficient home appliance, you'll need to have it installed correctly.

If you look behind your toilet, you'll see a supply line that runs from the outlet in the wall to the bottom of the toilet fill valve. This is how water enters your toilet.

If your fill valve is broken, not set at the proper level, or isn't set up appropriately, you might experience an often or continuously "running" toilet - which can cost you hundreds of dollars in wasted water.</p>
