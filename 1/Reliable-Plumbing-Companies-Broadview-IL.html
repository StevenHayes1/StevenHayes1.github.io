<p>Electric hot water heater do have a couple of disadvantages however that are worth pointing out. First and foremost, electricity is not as low-cost as gas. Some energy companies charge higher rates for electrical energy during peak durations such as very early in the morning and at night. Using your heater during these peak periods can increase your power expenses. On the hand, gas is low-cost and has a fixed rate. Another downside of an electrical water heater is that they can be expensive to install, especially when it comes to whole-house tankless systems.</p>
<p>During installation, electrical energy and water are shut off to the area. The old plumbing and sink flange are eliminated and cleaned up of any putty. Loosen up the nuts that link the drain pipe, including the curved trap, at the sink drain and near the wall or floor. Use your hands for PVC connections or a monkey wrench for metal connections. Place a bucket beneath the drain pipe to catch any water that leakages out.</p>
