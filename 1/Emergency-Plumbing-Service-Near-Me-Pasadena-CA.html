<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the concept of water softening has often been misunderstood as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure.

The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this decision a considerable one.</p>
