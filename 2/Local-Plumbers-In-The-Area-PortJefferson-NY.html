<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that doesn't work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. Many of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the suitable preventative measures if using among these products.</p>
<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually typically been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mainly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to customer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening merely eliminates hardness minerals and removes problems that are an annoyance and not a danger to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not requirement. However, water softening does have advantages, and drawbacks, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
<p>Softeners mainly eliminate calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are typically referred to as 'solidity minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they must be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a big warning that something more serious is wrong with them.</p>
