For years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it important to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any elements that speed up rust Likewise, there is a lack of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is an effective type of rust control.
