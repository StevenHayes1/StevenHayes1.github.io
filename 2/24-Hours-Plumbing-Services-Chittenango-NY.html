<p>SofTap's water softening technology is appropriate for household, commercial, and industrial applications, consisting of the prevention of limescale accumulation in homes and scaling in commercial water treatment systems, in addition to enhancing existing reverse osmosis treatment systems.

<p>The easiest way to keep you and your family safe from the potential dangers of backflow through cross connections is to not produce cross connections in the first location. However, if you do have a cross connection to a sprinkler system system, boiler, swimming pool, water feature or other kind of cross connection, have actually an approved backflow prevention assembly set up.</p>
<p>To prep your system for installation, you may have to connect a cord with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I attached a cable with a plug set that I bought individually from the disposal system. It's as basic as feeding the wires from the cord through the disposal and connecting them to the matching colors on the unit with wire nuts.</p>
<p>Although these property owners didn't feel lucky at the time, it was definitely good timing to camera the line prior to collapsing.

At the least, it would have been an extremely pricey alternative.</p>
