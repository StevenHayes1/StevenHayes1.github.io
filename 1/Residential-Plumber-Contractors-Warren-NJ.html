<p>Frequent leakages: Leakages originating from your water heater are never a great indication. It is likely more economical to replace the whole system if your water heater has frequent leaks or is constantly requiring repairs. A backflow preventer is a device that's installed on your house's water pipes that enables water to flow in one direction but never ever in the opposite direction. Its sole task is to prevent drinking water from being infected due to backflow.</p>
<p>Maintenance is another factor to consider. While you can purchase designs with unique functions that do whatever but add the salt, you will spend for each additional function. The tradeoff will be cost for benefit and you have no longterm guarantee that the special function will not fail.

Lastly, if you own a septic system, you must consider the additional load on your drainage field from backwashing and regrowth. Estimates show that about 50 gallons of water are used for each regeneration cycle. This might or may not cause hydraulic overload of the septic system.</p>
