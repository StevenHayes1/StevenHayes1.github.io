Unlike a drip leg, the flow of the gas is altered to get rid of any sediment. A sediment trap may be included in a drip leg install. The City needs backflow prevention devices to be installed anywhere there exists a connection that might allow tainted water into the City system or personal plumbing.

<p>Suggestion: Plug the sink with a stopper, fill with about an inch of water and inspect the flange and drain for leakages. Backflow - Do you notice water coming back in your sink or shower?
