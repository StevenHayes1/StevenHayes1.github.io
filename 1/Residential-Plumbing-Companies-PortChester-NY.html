<p>Water softeners resolve a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water participates in the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a sodium ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges bring in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the hard water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the solidity out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>

<h3>Water Heater Installation and Repair Tips at PortChester NY</h3>
<p>IRWD is dedicated to delivering safe, high quality water to consumers. Our comprehensive water quality program operates 24 hr a day, 365 days a year, to ensure that the water provided to our customers is kept devoid of hazardous contaminants. A vital part of our water quality program is the backflow prevention program When a water line is connected to devices containing a nonpotable substance, this is referred to as a cross-connection. Contamination may occur when water flows through a cross-connection from a nonpotable source, such as a sprinkler system or heating and cooling system, into the drinkable water system. This can take place through a procedure called backflow.</p>
<p>While lots of hot water heater problems can be effectively repaired, some issues will demand total hot water heater replacement. If your hot water heater is past its normal life-span (generally anywhere from 8 to ten years or longer if you have a tankless hot water heater) or if it has a major leak or extensive rust, it might be time to think about replacement.</p>
<p>The majority of homes or buildings that were built in the 1970s typically have galvanized piping. In time, the plumbing system can break and the pipes can start to rust. This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping includes iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather protection. As the external covering of zinc starts to wear down, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
<p>5. Pour hot water down your drain after utilizing the garbage disposal - In order to get rid of extraneous grease that can clog your kitchen sink, wash your drain with a bit of hot water. Whether tree roots have actually made their method into your pipes or you flushed something you shouldn't have, a clogged toilet is never an enjoyable experience. Luckily, you do not always need the assistance of a professional to fix it.</p>
