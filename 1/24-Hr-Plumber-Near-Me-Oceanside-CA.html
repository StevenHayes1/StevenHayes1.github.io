<p>Backpressure is created when pressure in a water supply surpasses the pressure in the drinkable system offering the make-up water. This can require the potable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the two systems. Potential pollutants can then get in the potable water system.

In some areas of Virginia, where the water is particularly hard with high mineral content, you might need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>

Scalding water is usually the outcome of a damaged pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water threatens and need to be right away dealt with by a qualified plumbing professional.</p>
