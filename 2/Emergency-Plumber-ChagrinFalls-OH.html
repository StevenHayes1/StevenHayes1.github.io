<p>Water softeners overcome a procedure called ion exchange which gets rid of calcium and magnesium from the water. When the hard water enters into the mineral tank, it streams through a bed of spherical resin beads These plastic beads, normally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, implying they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a favorable charge, making them cations. Given that opposite charges bring in, the negative charge of the minerals is drawn in to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the difficult water goes through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and eliminate them from the water. When the bead takes the mineral ion, the sodium ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it travels through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your house.</p>
