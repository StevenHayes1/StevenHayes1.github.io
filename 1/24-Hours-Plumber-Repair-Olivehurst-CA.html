The purpose of a repair on a backflow preventer is to return the assembly back to its initial factory working specifications. When the data indicates the backflow prevention assembly is in need of repair, the need for a repair can only be determined by performing a field test on the assembly and understanding.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in.. Many house centers bring just one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend a lot more. Likewise determine how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.

The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary type of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham checks backflow assemblies upon installation and performs regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be evaluated by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report need to be offered to the City of Bellingham.
