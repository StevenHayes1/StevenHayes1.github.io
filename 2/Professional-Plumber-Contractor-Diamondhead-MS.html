<p>Put your trust in a drain cleaning specialist with over 45 years of experience in drain cleaning services. These professionals will ensure your drains are totally clog-free once they're done. While a high quality, high horsepower disposal can grind and push just about anything down the kitchen sink, it doesn't indicate it's good for the pipes. Gas shut-off valve installation expenses between $52 and $138 per appliance, including labor and products. Materials cost $15 to $50 per valve, while labor runs $45 to $150 per hour. A shut-off valve is required to turn off the gas to the house whenever a home appliance needs repair or for emergencies.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the culprit. However not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's excessive slack in the chain, it can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing firmly. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger problem too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
