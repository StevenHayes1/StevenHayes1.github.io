<p>Backflow preventers must only be repaired when the information gathered from the field test indicates the assembly has broken down in its efficiency below the developed minimum standard. The test procedure is a diagnostic evaluation of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if essential, replaced. These minimum requirements are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to deteriorate in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working specifications. This suggests the assembly is repaired so that it can carry out above the minimum requirement.</p>
