<p>Inspections prevent a high portion of plumbing emergencies. There are some things you can do for your hot water heater to help it run effectively. It is necessary to make sure there is always two feet of clearance around it. You need to also drain about 25 percent of your tank regularly (a few times each year).

<p>Renovation plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more. With this technique, you know the turnkey rate entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
