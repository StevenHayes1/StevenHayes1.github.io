<p>The need for backflow preventers is apparent, but how do they work and which styles are best for certain applications? Frequently the type and installation requirements are spelled out by environmental regulations and local statutes. Local building regulations for example will require a vertical separation of a minimum of one inch to form an air space in between a faucet opening and the highest possible water level in its sink or basin. The resultant space breaks any possible siphon before it can take place, avoiding contaminating water from being sucked back into the pipe system. Other laws can require the installation of more complex and sophisticated backflow preventers. And the design of these mechanical devices set up to avoid backflow range from the fairly basic to the very sophisticated and complex.</p>

All brand-new replacement pipes have a projected lifespan of one a century and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another efficient method is pipe relining.
