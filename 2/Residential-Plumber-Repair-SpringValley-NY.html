<h3>Unclog Drains, Toilets and Sewers With The Help of SpringValley NY Plumbers</h3>

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the drain is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers carry only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with an elongated" design, the door might not close.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and hope for the very best is common in our market and lots of companies try to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Once again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the crucial to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization correctly working together that you can accomplish this.</p>
