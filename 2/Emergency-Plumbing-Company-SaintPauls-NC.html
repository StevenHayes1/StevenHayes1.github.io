<p>Water softeners leaks are primarily caused due to the fact that of a concern at the point of installation or due to the fact that of maintenance. When setting up the plumbing to your softener, take your time and ensure your fittings are threaded well and your push-to-connect fittings are seated properly. If the bypass valve is split, it can also cause the system to leak. Bypass valves are fitted with -rings that might need to be re-lubricated or changed with time. A broken rotor valve or rotor valve seal might also be the culprit. The rotor valve directs the water throughout the system throughout softening and regeneration procedures. A worn water valve can lock up and spring a leak. If the rotor valve's seal is leaking, it is most likely split and merely needs to be replaced.</p>
