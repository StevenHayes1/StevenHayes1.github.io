You could be squandering money with every flush if your toilet was produced before 1994. Older toilets use up to 3.5 gallons per flush-- more than double the modern requirement. A Broken Dip Tube: The dip tube is used to vent all of the fresh water from the water line to the bottom of your tank so that it can warm much faster. If you discover that cold water is coming out of your faucet even when you are turning the hot knob, it is most likely that your dip tube is broken.</p>
<p>If there is backflow at your house, you might infect your drinking water with non-treated water from a watering canal or water pooled around a sprinkler head that has fertilizer on it.
