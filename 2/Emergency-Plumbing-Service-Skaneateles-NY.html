<p>When lime is contributed to the water, it changes the water chemistry, triggering the calcium to come out of the solution. The particles of calcium integrate, become heavier than the remainder of the water and sink to the bottom of the holding basins. The clear water then moves into the next action of the treatment process. Flexible gas lines are usually more suitable to inflexible lines, especially in areas where earthquakes are more common and for the connection between the supply and home appliance. Versatile gas lines are less most likely to be detached in a natural disaster which reduces the risk of an explosion or fire.</p>
