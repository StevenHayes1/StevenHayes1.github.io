<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor MontgomeryVillage MD</h3>
<p>Seattle Public Utilities requires that any cross connection have a backflow preventer. The backflow preventer might be needed to be found on the water service line, within the building, or both areas. After a preliminary inspection and testing of a freshly set up backflow preventer, the water consumer is required to have the backflow preventer evaluated on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>The watering backflow testing season is from May to September. Watering backflow prevention assemblies need to be tested by a certified backflow assembly tester as the water is turned on to make sure appropriate backflow prevention remains in location to protect our drinking water during the irrigation season. Denver Water will send out a testing pointer notice one month before the annual test is due.</p>
