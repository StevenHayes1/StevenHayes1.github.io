"Regrowing" describes the method softeners clean all the calcium and magnesium mineral deposits out of the filter medium when it ends up being "exhausted" or full. However, many water softeners regrow frequently, when the filter medium truly isn't full. This can be remedied by simply resetting your water softener to get rid of less hardness or to run longer between regeneration cycles.</p>
