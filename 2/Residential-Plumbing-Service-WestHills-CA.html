Whether it's calcium, iron, or another element that is causing the corrosion, you will ultimately experience a leak in your hot water heater that is difficult to repair. Leaks often mean a brand-new unit replacement remains in order.</p>
<p>Other pipe repair techniques include our Pipe Pull method and pipe relining.
