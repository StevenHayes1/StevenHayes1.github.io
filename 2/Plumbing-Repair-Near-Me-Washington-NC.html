<p>The U-shaped pipe beneath kitchen and bathroom sinks is something that people anticipate to see but seldom stop to consider. 106.2.2.1 Other than Group R-3 Occupancies. The intent of the 10-percent guideline exemptions in Area 106.2.2 shall apply to small repairs and replacement piping just. In structures aside from Group R-3 tenancies, a permit and inspection shall be needed for more comprehensive work if more than 10-percent (nominal) of a floor level, wing, or area is involved, although the floor level, wing, or area specifies less than 10-percent (small) of the overall building plumbing.</p>
