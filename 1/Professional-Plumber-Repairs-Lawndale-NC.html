<p>A backflow preventer is a way or mechanism to prevent backflow. The fundamental means of avoiding backflow is an air space, which either removes a cross-connection or supplies a barrier to backflow. The standard system for avoiding backflow is a mechanical backflow preventer, which offers a physical barrier to backflow. The principal types of mechanical backflow preventer are the reduced-pressure principle assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly. A secondary kind of mechanical backflow preventer is the residential dual check valve.</p>
<p>You live in an older house. There's a great chance that you'll need to have it done quickly if your house is 50 years old or older and you've never changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were usually set up in houses of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to rust and burst when they get old. You may need to include a grounded outlet to power the garbage disposal if you do not currently have one if so. This generally adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the general cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
