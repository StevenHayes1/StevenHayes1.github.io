Depending upon the length of time the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can get a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite an annoyance-- for its lots of designated usages around your house.</p>
