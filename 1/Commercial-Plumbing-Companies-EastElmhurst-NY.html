When chemicals are included to a fire protection system provided by a drinkable water supply, increased defense is likewise needed. Remind them to prevent hanging on any noticeable pipelines or playing with the outdoor gas meter if you have kids. Hanging on a pipeline may cause it to come loose or break, launching gas into the home. The outdoor gas meter should be kept clear of any debris, such as plants or snow, so it is easily available in an emergency.</p>
