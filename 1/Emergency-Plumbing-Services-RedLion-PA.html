<p>Leak detection is a component of water preservation that relies on extremely technical expertise and customized devices to determine the place of leakages throughout the city's water distribution system and pinpoint the location of those leakages at which visible water might or may not have actually surfaced.

Running toilets can be the outcome of a corroded overflow pipe, worn flush valve assembly, or broken flapper valve. Give the specialists at Wingate a call to repair your running toilet and minimize wasted water.</p>
<p>Setting up a gas line to power a water heater and heating system typically costs $350 to $600. On top of the gas line costs, heater installation costs vary from $2,150 to $5,900. If you're upgrading from electrical to gas, water heater installation expenses are between $650 and $1,600.
