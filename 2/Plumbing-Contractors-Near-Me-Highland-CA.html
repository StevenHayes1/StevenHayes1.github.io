I in fact received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel.

His group was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary issue and installing a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a third time as they worked their method through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
