<p>I had a major sewer issue with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I really received their number for another company that could not come soon enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and give me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, enabling the occupants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further investigation, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to investigate. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary issue and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This occurred yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
