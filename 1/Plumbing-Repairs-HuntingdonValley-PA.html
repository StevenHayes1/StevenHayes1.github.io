Roto-Rooter serviceman cleans a main sewer from a basement cleanout gain access to point with one of the company's sewer cleaning devices.</p>
<p>Then attach the waste pipe (and dishwasher hose, if relevant).

<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend far more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey rate entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
