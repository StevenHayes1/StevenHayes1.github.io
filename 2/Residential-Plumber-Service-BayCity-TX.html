We specialize in garbage disposal installation and repair, in addition to kitchen plumbing, bathroom plumbing, toilet clogs, drain cleaning, water leakages, water heater repair and installation, and re-piping.</p>

<p>Because the copper pipes have not had a possibility to end up being coated within, New homes constructed with copper pipes are particularly susceptible to destructive water conditions. As suggested by the MDH, it is best NOT to soften the water in a brand-new home for a period of three to 5 months after occupancy. This can be done by simply bypassing the water softener's filter medium. See your owner's manual for instructions on bypassing your softener. Lots of brand-new houses are constructed with PEX and not copper.</p>
