<p>Learn if there are any lead pipes in the house. Residences that were constructed prior to 1986 typically have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you understand, no matter how beneficial, is an environmental toxic substance (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in houses that is not lead based). You might not desire to live in a house that has lead pipes if you have children.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham examines backflow assemblies upon installation and carries out regular re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies should be tested by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to putting into service. A copy of the test report need to be supplied to the City of Bellingham. Your water will taste much better. The minerals in hard water can trigger a bad odor and taste. When you add a water softener, it eliminates the mineral content to produce odor-free drinking water that tastes excellent.</p>
