<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
