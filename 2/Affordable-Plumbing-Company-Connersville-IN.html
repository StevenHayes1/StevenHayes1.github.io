<p>Steamfitters and pipefitters, often just called fitters, install and maintain pipes that may bring chemicals, gases, and acids. These pipes are primarily in manufacturing, commercial, and industrial settings.

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to examine the line and figure out the reason for the problem. The line was clearly deteriorating; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
