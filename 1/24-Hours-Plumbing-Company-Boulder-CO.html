<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Boulder CO?</h3>
<p>What is tough water? Clinically speaking, it is water which contains substantial quantities of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it picks up these minerals on its journey. Depending on for how long the water travels through the ground before reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals won't damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water inappropriate-- and quite a nuisance-- for its numerous intended usages around your house.</p>
<p>Garbage disposals are an important feature in any modern kitchen. If you live in an older house, your sink might not have one, forcing you to be persistent about keeping food scraps from streaming down the drain.

Copper pipes are environmentally friendly and are resistant to splitting. Nevertheless, they're also the most expensive in this list and in locations with difficult water (like Florida) they can develop pinhole leakages.</p>
