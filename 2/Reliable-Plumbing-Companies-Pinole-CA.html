<p>Discharge piping connected to a storm sewer shall be geared up with backwater check valve. In commercial applications, for instance, AWWA M-14: Backflow Prevention and Cross-Connection Control Recommended Practices advises a DCV assembly on damp or dry sprinkler systems unless there is a risk of a high-hazard cross-connection. In those cases, an RPZ assembly is suggested.</p>
<p>The system has actually gone back to a zero need condition (no valves open downstream). However, debris between the # 1 Examine Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the parts, is preventing the # 1 Check from closing all the way. This enables pressure to equalize between the Supply Side and the Zone of Lowered Pressure. When this takes place, the Relief Valve Spring presses back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>
<p>A check backflow preventer includes two spring-loaded check assemblies to avoid back and back siphonage pressure on non-health danger (low threat) systems. Unscrew the coupling nut that connects the supply line. If the toilet valve turns inside the toilet tank, hold its base with a locking pliers. Pointer: Throw a towel on the floor below to capture water that will drain from the line.</p>
