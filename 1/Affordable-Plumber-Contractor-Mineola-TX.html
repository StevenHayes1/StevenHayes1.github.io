<p>Does it appear like your drains are constantly slow or clogged? Often, this is triggered by built-up sediment and other materials that are causing a clog in your sewer drain. Where other drain cleaning and plumbing companies will attempt to charge you an arm and a leg to dig up and clean your sewer line, Northwest Drain Station uses hydro jetting, a highly reliable option for dislodging persistent materials that have stayed with the walls of your pipeline, restoring a healthy circulation to your drains.</p>
<p>Most toilets utilized today operate with a standard gravity flushing design, indicating they utilize the force of the gravity to press the clean water into the bowl and then on into the sewage system. Recently, however, toilets using a vacuum flushing system have actually been appearing in more and more homes. This system utilizes a vacuum-assisted flushing system to draw the water into the bowl and down into the sewage systems. A drawback of this device is that it's far more tough to unblock your toilet were to end up being clogged.</p>
