<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to inspect the line and figure out the reason for the issue. The line was plainly degrading; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even even worse, the line could collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
