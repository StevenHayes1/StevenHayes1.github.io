It needed to be pulled by a truck and included a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It can cleaning large commercial and community sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable television. It was ceased in 1973.</p>

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line in between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to check the line and determine the reason for the problem. The line was plainly weakening; some areas were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a significant repair or replacement.</p>
