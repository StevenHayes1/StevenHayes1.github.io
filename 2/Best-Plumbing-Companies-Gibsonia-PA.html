<p>Borax sits in the exact very same family of water softeners as washing soda. Borax is a precipitating water softener and it includes the same downsides i.e. skin irritation and accumulation. If either of these drawbacks are inappropriate to you - you'll wish to discover what's called a non-precipitating water softener. Switch on the water to fill the toilet tank.
