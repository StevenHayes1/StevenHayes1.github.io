<h3>Safe Alternatives In Fixing A Blocked Drain in Darien CT</h3>
<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
