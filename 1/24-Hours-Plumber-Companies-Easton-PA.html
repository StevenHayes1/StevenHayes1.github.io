When tough water passes through the softening system's resin bed, the calcium and magnesium (firmness) ions are gotten rid of through an ion exchange process, so just softened water goes through to your home. When the resin bed fills with firmness ions, it must be regenerated (cleaned up). Salt is generally used in the regrowth procedure and restores the resin to a "clean" state so the ion exchange procedure can begin again.</p>
