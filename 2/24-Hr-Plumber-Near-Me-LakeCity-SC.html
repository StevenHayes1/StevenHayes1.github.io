<p>During typical operation, the pressure in between the two check valves, referred to as the zone of lowered pressure, is kept at a lower pressure than the supply pressure. If either check valve should leak, the relief valve is created to release and open water to the exterior. An RPZ will periodically discharge small amounts of water due to fluctuation in line pressure up or downstream of the assembly. For this factor, the RPZ needs to be installed in areas that are exempt to water damage and allow sufficient drainage.</p>
