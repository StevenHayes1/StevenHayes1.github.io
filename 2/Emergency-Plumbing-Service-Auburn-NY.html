<p>We really care about our customers and the services that we offer. As difficult water travels through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade locations with salt ions (Figure 1). Sodium ions are held loosely and are replaced easily by calcium and magnesium ions. During this procedure, complimentary" salt ions are launched into the water. The time in between recharging cycles depends upon the solidity of the water, the amount of water utilized, the size of the system and the capacity of the exchange media to get rid of solidity.</p>

<p>I had a significant sewer issue with a 1940s home, with rainwater and sewage was supporting into the basement shower. I started calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact received their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to examine and offer me a quote. They right away cleared the initial clog, allowing for the occupants to return from a hotel. Sadly, upon additional investigation, there was a significant obstruction that needed excavation to examine. His group was on site the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this initial issue and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed. This happened yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
