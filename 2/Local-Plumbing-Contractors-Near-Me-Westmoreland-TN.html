<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>As a locally-owned business, integrity and responsibility are incredibly important to building a track record for excellence. One typical method for a home's water supply to be polluted is if the watering water lines, which might end up being polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that contaminated water were to backflow into the community drinking supply, the issue could spread out exponentially. A backflow preventer not just secures drinking water in private houses, it also prevents wastewater in private houses from flowing back out and infecting the public supply of water.</p>
<p>The HydroFLOW water conditioner keeps minerals, algae, and germs from ending up being an issue in your water supply by sending an electrical signal of 150 kilohertz (kHz) through your plumbing system. The signal causes the minerals to join together, forming clusters that ultimately form stable crystals. These crystals do not hold on to surface areas like private minerals would.</p>

<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts need to be removed and replaced with new rubber parts. It is very important that just original factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts.
