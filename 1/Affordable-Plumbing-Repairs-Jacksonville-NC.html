<p>I had a significant sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I began calling any number I might find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and offer me a quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a considerable clog that required excavation to investigate. His group was on site the extremely next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a 3rd time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
