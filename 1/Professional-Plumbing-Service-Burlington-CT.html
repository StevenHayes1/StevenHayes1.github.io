<p>A water softener is a whole-house filtration system that removes hardness-causing calcium and magnesium minerals from your water through a procedure called ion exchange.  A water softener addresses one of the most disastrous and prevalent water problems: tough water.  Tough water wreaks havoc on the modern-day home. Scale develops in your pipes, obstructing them and decreasing water pressure.  Scale dramatically reduces the lifespan of appliances like dishwashing machines, coffee machine and ice devices. Hard water ruins hot water appliances. The greater the temperature level of the water, the more calcium and magnesium will solidify and solidify into strong deposits inside your warm water heater.</p>
