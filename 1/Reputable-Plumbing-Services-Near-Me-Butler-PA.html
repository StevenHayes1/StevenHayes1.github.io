<p>Discover if there are any lead pipes in the house. Homes that were built prior to 1986 often have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how beneficial, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded gasoline and paint in houses that is not lead based).

<p>Improvement plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this method, you understand the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
