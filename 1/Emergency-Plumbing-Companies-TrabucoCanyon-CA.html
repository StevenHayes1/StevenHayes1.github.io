Nevertheless, debris in between the # 1 Examine Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the elements, is preventing the # 1 Inspect from closing all the method. This permits pressure to equalize between the Supply Side and the Zone of Lowered Pressure. When this takes place, the Relief Valve Spring presses back versus the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>
