<p>You want to save water. Older toilets use up to 7 gallons of water per flush and are much less water-efficient than more recent designs.

<p>Home water softeners, likewise called ion exchange units, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
