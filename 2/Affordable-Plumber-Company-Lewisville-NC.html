<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc created and constructed a smaller design that operated on the exact same principle however might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also built a much bigger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be pulled by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and local sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was stopped in 1973.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, dealing with plumbing problems is part of home ownership. When the time comes, you need knowledgeable professionals that you can rely on to finish the job right. At Waldrop Plumbing - Heating - Air, we have 50 years of experience supplying repiping in Greenville, SC and Spartanburg Counties.

<p>Renovation plumbers typically charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey price going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
