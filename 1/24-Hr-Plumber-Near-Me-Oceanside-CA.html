<p>Backpressure is created when pressure in a water supply surpasses the pressure in the drinkable system offering the make-up water. This can require the potable water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection between the two systems. Potential pollutants can then get in the potable water system. The best way to decrease build-up is have a professional flush it at least as soon as a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is particularly hard with high mineral content, you might need to flush the water heater more frequently.</p>

Scalding water is usually the outcome of a damaged pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water threatens and need to be right away dealt with by a qualified plumbing professional.</p>
