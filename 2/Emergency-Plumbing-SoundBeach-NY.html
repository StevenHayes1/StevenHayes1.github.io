<p>Making use of backflow preventers is tied to the water's usage. Backflow preventers are used to ensure the safety and pureness of the distributed water. Commercial supply of water normally has a minimum requirement of quality, depending on the commercial process in concern. Farming on the other hand has less stringent water quality requirements. However where backflow preventers are most necessary is in the supply of potable water for individual and domestic usage.</p>
<p>Because of the inherent design of a minimized pressure backflow assembly, fluctuating supply pressure on an incredibly low circulation or static circulation condition might cause nuisance leaking and possible fouling of the assembly. While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve immediately ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure constant to the assembly in times of varying supply pressure.</p>
