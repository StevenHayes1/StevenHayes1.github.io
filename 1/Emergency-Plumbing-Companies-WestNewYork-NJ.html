<p>It may be time to get it replaced if your water heater has actually required several repairs over the last couple of years. A good general rule for water heaters is this: since the life-span of the average hot water heater is in between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the middle. If the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point, then it makes more monetary sense to replace your hot water heater.</p>
<p>Before selection and installation, describe manufacturers literature for temperature ranges. All assemblies need to be protected from freezing temperatures and if installed where temperature levels will reach 100 degrees F or above, a hot water type assembly should be used. Consult makers specifications for recommendations. When looking for plumbing services in the area, be specific with your requirements and ask candidates if they are licensed plumbers and if they have the sophisticated experience and licenses connected with a plumbing contractor.</p>
