<p>We truly appreciate our customers and the services that we offer. As tough water passes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade locations with sodium ions (Figure 1). Salt ions are held loosely and are replaced quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this procedure, complimentary" salt ions are launched into the water. The time in between charging cycles depends upon the hardness of the water, the amount of water used, the size of the system and the capability of the exchange media to get rid of firmness.</p>
<p>You have galvanized iron pipes. I had Rate Busters replace a water heater tank and a main water shut off valve. They were extremely responsive and prompt to send me a bid which was very competitive. They were very professional and did a remarkable job. I would definitely call them once again for my plumbing needs. Now, if this discoloration only appears when hot water is being utilized, then the rust most likely exists within your water heater tank and not in your pipes. This is naturally still a problem that needs to be dealt with right away (you'll likely need a brand-new hot water heater) but not one that needs repiping.</p>
