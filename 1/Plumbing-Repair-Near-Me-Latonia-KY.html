That smell might be coming from your sewer system, which requires repair right away. If your vent stack, the part of your plumbing system that eliminates sewage from your home, releases sewer gas, and regulates atmospheric pressure in the waste-system pipes has stopped working, it will often need to be replaced instead of fixed.
