<p>As the water treatment industry has actually grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually frequently been misconstrued as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure. This is due mainly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to customer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. But the reality is that water softening merely removes firmness minerals and gets rid of problems that are an annoyance and not a danger to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and disadvantages, that make this choice a substantial one.</p>
<p>To prep your unit for installation, you might have to connect a cable with a plug to reach the outlet, or extension wires to reach a hardwired box In this case, I connected a cable with a plug set that I purchased independently from the disposal system.
