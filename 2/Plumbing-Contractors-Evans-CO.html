<p>In the typical repair, the old rubber parts must be gotten rid of and changed with new rubber parts. It is essential that only initial factory repair parts are used when putting the backflow prevention assembly back together whether they are hardware or rubber parts. The rubber parts the maker produces for the assembly are the only ones the assembly was designed to use and altering the rubber from the original factory parts will impact the operation of the backflow prevention assembly and void any approvals.</p>
<p>Next comes the metal install ring and rubber cushion mount (or cushion ring). Their proper orientation will be labeled. These two pieces have complementary grooves that when correctly fitted together hold the install ring and disposal in location. Holding the mount ring at the upper part of the flange, work the cushion mount over the bottom of the flange, ensuring that the rubber of the cushion install is fully and strongly locking into the groove on the bottom of the flange. When set up properly, you ought to not be able to remove the cushion install without substantial pulling and extending, and the mount ring should turn easily around it.</p>
