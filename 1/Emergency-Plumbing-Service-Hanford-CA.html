<p>When selecting the proper system defense there are numerous considerations we need to take a look at. In my mind there is no one size fits all circumstances in the cross-connection world. Each and every installation must be taken a look at on an individual basis as an unique stand-alone system. The National Fire Defense Association NFPA 13 Standard for the installation of sprinkler systems consists of the requirement for the lawn sprinkler themselves. Fire defense system are developed to match the danger that exists in the locations they are set up in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be extremely different, we need to comprehend that the fire protection system for any installation requires to be developed and installed to fulfill that particular hazard or need.
