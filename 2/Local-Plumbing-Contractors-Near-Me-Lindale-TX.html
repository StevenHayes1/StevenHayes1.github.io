<p>The most common issue with faucets is the leak and drip Not only can this happen in any place with a faucet such as kitchens, bathrooms, and more - but it can be a progressive concern that becomes a major problem.

Often the leak or drip will be triggered by a harmed faucet, worn out washers or seals, wore away -rings and gaskets, or parts that are simply too old and need to be replacement.
