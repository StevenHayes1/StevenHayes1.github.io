In extreme cases, hard-water deposits can drastically restrict the water flow, which puts excessive pressure on the entire plumbing system.</p>

<p>After showing up after their window, they began to investigate the kitchen sink (and after among the 2 gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together however claimed they wouldn't take duty if it leaked now because of some unspecified quirks in how my sink was created. After they gave me the "don't pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I observed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to try calling them back, since I never ever want to see this company again.</p>
<p>I can't state enough advantages about this company. Had a sewer repair required and had a really brief quantity of time due to closing on a house sale. Every single individual I encountered from Marquita doing logistics for my task to every member of the work team. Friendly, interacted well, completely responsive and actually cared to help me through this very demanding job. All of the people I experienced were role models for what a well run service organisation should be. Much thanks and appreciation. You're excellent.</p>
