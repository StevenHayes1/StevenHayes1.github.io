A water softener collects hardness minerals within its conditioning tank and from time to time flushes them away to drain. Ion exchangers are often used for water softening. When an ion exchanger is looked for water softening, it will replace the calcium and magnesium ions in the water with other ions such as salt or potassium.</p>
<p>Some producers declare that the electrical devices they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces.
