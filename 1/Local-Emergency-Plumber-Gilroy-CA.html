<p>Frequent leaks: Leakages coming from your water heater are never ever a great indication. If your water heater has frequent leakages or is continuously needing repairs, it is likely more affordable to replace the whole system.

Its sole job is to avoid drinking water from being polluted due to backflow.</p>
<p>Softeners mainly remove calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently referred to as 'hardness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they must be (more than water flowing through the pipes), that's a substantial red flag that something more major is wrong with them.</p>
