<h3>Top Rated Atlanta Plumber Libertyville IL</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to conventional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. Throughout durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's perhaps the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
