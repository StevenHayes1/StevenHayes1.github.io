Generally speaking, more knowledgeable plumbers will charge more for their services. Tankless hot water heater remove the long wait for heat of the conventional warm water tank. Plumbing pipes, like everything else, wear out in time. Usually, it is best to replace the pipes when the damage is too extensive for repair.

<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is only half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and wish for the best is common in our market and many companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other design on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media transforms the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stick to anything even under severe temperatures. It's just with the media and the fluidization appropriately working together that you can achieve this.</p>
