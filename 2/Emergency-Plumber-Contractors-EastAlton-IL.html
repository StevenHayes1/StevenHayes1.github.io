An excellent rule of thumb for water heaters is this: because the life expectancy of the typical water heater is between 8-12 years, around 5-6 years is the halfway point. It makes more monetary sense to replace your water heater if the cost of a repair is more than half the cost of a replacement at that point.</p>

Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
