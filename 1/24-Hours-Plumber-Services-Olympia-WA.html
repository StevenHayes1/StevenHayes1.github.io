<p>When pipes are organized into a vertical form it is described as a hydrostatic loop. In this configuration the loop must be greater than 33 feet to operate properly. When developed this way it avoids siphoning and backflow into a water system. Plumb Crazy Plumbing uses a basic one month warranty on repairs, drain cleaning and 1 year warranty on replacement plumbing tasks.</p>
<p>A brand-new trend in re-piping is sand blasting the inside of used thin pipe and the painting the inside of the used pipe with epoxy paint. Sometimes throughout the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of pipes and joints. A few of those thin areas leak right now and sometimes those leakages come weeks or days later on. Leaking pipes that are epoxy-coated end up needing to be correctly re-piped by installing a CDA copper re-pipe.</p>
