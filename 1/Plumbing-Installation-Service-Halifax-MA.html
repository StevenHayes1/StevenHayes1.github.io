<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water system.

Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
