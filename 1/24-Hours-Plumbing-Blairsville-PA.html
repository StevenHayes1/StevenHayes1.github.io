<p>We really appreciate our consumers and the services that we offer. As hard water goes through a softener, the calcium and magnesium trade locations with salt ions (Figure 1). Sodium ions are held loosely and are changed easily by calcium and magnesium ions. During this process, free" sodium ions are launched into the water. The time between recharging cycles depends on the hardness of the water, the quantity of water used, the size of the unit and the capacity of the exchange media to eliminate firmness.</p>
