<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Coalinga CA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Instead of a large, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high circulation need, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new technique to softening is called responsive or progressive circulation innovation, and it's arguably the most important innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
