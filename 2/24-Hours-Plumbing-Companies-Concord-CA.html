<p>When the data gathered from the field test shows the assembly has broken down in its performance listed below the established minimum standard, backflow preventers need to just be fixed. The test procedure is a diagnostic assessment of the operations of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum standard, the backflow preventer must be repaired or if necessary, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly begins to weaken in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The function of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This implies the assembly is repaired so that it can perform above the minimum requirement.</p>
