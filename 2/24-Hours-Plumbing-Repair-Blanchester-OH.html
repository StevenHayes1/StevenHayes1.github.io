<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves need to remain open and the system must be constantly kept track of. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as easy as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm system that notifies the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems make use of both techniques. NFPA 13 refers to all such gadgets as supervisory gadgets.</p>
<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the principle of water softening has actually frequently been misunderstood as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning procedure.
