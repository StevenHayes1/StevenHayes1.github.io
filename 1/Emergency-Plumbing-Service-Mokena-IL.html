<p>Water softener systems work by getting rid of hardness minerals and changing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale.

Due to the reality that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener alternative in areas where it is prohibited to utilize salt.

<p>Small leaks ought to never ever be neglected, as they can suggest that a bigger problem exists. Although some leaks may be separated concerns, they can also point to an overall problem with the structure of your pipes.
