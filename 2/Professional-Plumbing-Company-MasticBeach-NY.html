<p>Our licensed plumbing specialists can do this for you, or you can do it yourself by connecting a hose to drain the tank to a suitable drain. Flushing the water heating tank must be done 2x every year. So, while a chemical drain cleaner may provide a fast fix in the short term, it can trigger far more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run. An excellent place to begin searching for the leaking kitchen sink plumbing unit is underneath the puddle of water or where you appear to feel the moisture most.</p>
<p>Extreme rust, or rusty water, might indicate the tank will need to be replaced.

<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the culprit. However not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper.
