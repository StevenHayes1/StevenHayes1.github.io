<h3>Things To Know Before Hiring A Sewer Cleaning Company in PortWashington NY</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves should stay open and the system should be continually kept track of. Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either prevents the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as simple as a locked chain through the control valve that avoids that valve from opening, or an alarm that informs the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems utilize both techniques. NFPA 13 describes all such devices as supervisory gadgets.</p>
