<p>Other pipe repair techniques include our Pipe Pull method and pipe relining. The Pipe Pull technique interchanges damaged sewer or water lines with brand-new piping by the usage of a tiny hole at the front and back of the piping run. The broken sewer line guides the new piping into location. All new replacement pipes have a projected life expectancy of one a century and are code certified, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak evidence. Another reliable method is pipe relining. Pipe relining basically eliminates the need for broken pipe removal. By inserting a hardening lining material which coats the inside of the existing pipe, a new pipe is developed inside the broken one.</p>
