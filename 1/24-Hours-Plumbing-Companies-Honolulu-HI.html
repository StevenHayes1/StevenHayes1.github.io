<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly dripped in the previous. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was quite affordable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>
<p>According to the Epa, cross-connections can be a severe public health threat if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies set up. There are many, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have been accountable for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of sickness or illness.</p>
