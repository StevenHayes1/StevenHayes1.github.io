<h3>How To Keep Bathroom Sinks Running Smoothly at Marina CA</h3>
<p>While not every state requires insurance before contractor licenses are issued, having your own guarantees the safety of your company. Unexpected occasions and undesirable scenarios might take place anytime and being unprepared can put your business in huge financial trouble. To be safe instead of sorry, getting the right insurance coverage for your plumbing company serves as a defense against monetary threats and service jeopardies.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Many house centers bring only one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. Be prepared to invest much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
