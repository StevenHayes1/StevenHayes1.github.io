This can trigger low water pressure and impact the hot water within the plumbing system. Galvanized piping consists of iron pipes that have been coded with zinc to offer weather condition security. As the external coating of zinc starts to deteriorate, the pipe is exposed to water and wetness, causing the iron to eventually rust.</p>
