<p>The source or area of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another.

Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main drains traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>

The drain is linked, and the disposal linked to its mount 1 The rest of the plumbing is reconnected to the disposal and to the dishwasher. The electricity is linked, and whatever is sealed and tested. When searching for a waste disposal unit, you need to speak with a professional plumber who can provide you with information on the different kinds of disposals offered on the market.</p>
