<p>Keep your kitchen plumbing running smoothly and learn about replacing and keeping faucets, garbage disposals and more.

<p>Aside from these 2 essential components, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less important things that can weaken or break. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom.

When this occurs, we recommend that you hire among our professional plumbers to help you unclog your toilet.</p>
<p>Secure the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the depleted brine option after the regrowth cycle. Clamp the drain hose safely and feed it into the dedicated drain, like a floor drain or utility sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain hoses should have an air gap. The end of the hose be at least 2 inches above the dedicated drain. An air gap might be used to attain this, and may be needed depending upon local plumbing codes.</p>
