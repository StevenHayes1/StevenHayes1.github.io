So, while a chemical drain cleaner may offer a quick fix in the short term, it can cause much more problems, damage, and headaches in the long run. A great place to begin looking for the leaking kitchen sink plumbing unit is underneath the puddle of water or where you appear to feel the wetness most.</p>
