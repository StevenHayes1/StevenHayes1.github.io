<h3>How To Overcome Emergency Plumbing Issues Rodeo CA</h3>
<p>Root Invasion: Root invasion refers to what takes place when tree roots start to grow around and into your drain and sewer lines This happens because the wetness in these lines is a natural fertilizer for tree roots. When roots ultimately do piece your drain lines, they can trigger blockages, breaks, and back-ups which may result in extensive residential or commercial property damage. Keep an eye out for wet, green spots in your lawn, a consistent sewage smell in or around your house, an uptick in rodent and insect activity, and slow drains, as these are all common indications of root intrusion.</p>
<p>There are a number of signs to keep an eye out for. 1) The surface area of the floor in one area is warm and even hot to the touch. 2) The dial on your water meter keeps spinning, even when all appliances and components in your home have actually been shut off. 3) The hot water heater seems to be running all the time. 4) All this amounts to greater gas and water bills, often really rapidly.</p>
