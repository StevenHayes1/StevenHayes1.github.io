I really got their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They right away cleared the initial obstruction, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Regrettably, upon further examination, there was a significant clog that needed excavation to examine. His team was on site the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to start digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed.
