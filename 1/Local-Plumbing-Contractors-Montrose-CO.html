<h3>How To Repair Your Water Heater at Montrose CO</h3>

<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast majority of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. However with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring just one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to spend much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Keep reading to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
