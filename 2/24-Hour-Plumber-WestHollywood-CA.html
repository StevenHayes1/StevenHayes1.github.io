<p>The High Voltage Leak Detection Innovation (HVLD) testing process includes a set of electrode probes which scans a sealed container made of a non-conductive material. Some disposer units do not featured a power cable attached. Remove the plate with a screwdriver to access the electrical circuitry (Image 1) if this is the case. Make certain to acquire a wiring set with the appropriate power score and hardware for your disposer system (Images 2 and 3). Make sure the cable is long enough to reach the receptacle without stretching the cord when you connect the circuitry harness to the disposer.</p>
