<p>While many hot water heater problems can be efficiently repaired, some problems will require complete hot water heater replacement. If your water heater is past its typical life-span (normally anywhere from 8 to 10 years or longer if you have a tankless hot water heater) or if it has a major leak or substantial rust, it may be time to think about replacement.</p>

Toilet repair or replacement can be a dirty job, something that many people might not feel comfy with doing. Still, it's something you and your family usage numerous times a day, so it is essential - and cost-efficient - for it be running smoothly and dependably.
