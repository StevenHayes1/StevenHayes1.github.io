<p>Duty for installation falls upon the owner of the co-op or the home or condominium board. Owners and boards of buildings that are issued an order by the DEP to install a backflow preventer should file strategies with the DEP within thirty days.

<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their new home and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we utilized our sewer camera to inspect the line and identify the cause of the problem. The line was clearly degrading; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line could collapse requiring a major repair or replacement.</p>
