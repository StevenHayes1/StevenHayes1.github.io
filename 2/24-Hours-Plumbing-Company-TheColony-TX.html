<h3>24 Hour Plumber & Water Heater Services TheColony TX</h3>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line blockages are not something a house owner can fix. This kind of clog requires a professional plumber or drain professional to use a drain cleaning machine to find the clog and get it cleared. TLC can use a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are geared up with this type of camera to repair the drain and determine issue. If you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic system, this type of camera is particularly beneficial in finding a problem.</p>
