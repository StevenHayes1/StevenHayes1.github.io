<p>Backpressure backflow is brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
