Detach the disposal from the flange assembly and eliminate it from the drain. Purchased the Insinkerator from Lowes for $199 + $15 tax. Installation by a plumber cost $275, however he likewise needed to replace rusty inlet water pipes. About 1.5 hours total.</p>
<p>If you see rust just in your hot water, then examine the status of your water heater's anode rod. If you've never done this on your own, you may need a professional to do this. If the anode rod is rusted out, the rust is most likely originating from the inside of your water heater. Replace your hot water heater as quickly as possible if this is the case. On the other hand, if you see rust from both your cold and hot water taps, you more than likely have worn away piping.</p>
