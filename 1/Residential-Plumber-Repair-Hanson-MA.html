<p>Wondering how much do plumbers charge to snake a drain? While each case of a clogged drain is different to the next, here are some rough estimates on what a plumber cost to snake a drain is. While there are a lot of variables that may come into play, here is how plumbers generally charge for drain snaking. The waste disposal unit is clogged or gradually draining.

Some products that ought to never be put into the disposal include fats, oils, grease, egg shells, potatoes, coffee grinds, rice, and bones.</p>
