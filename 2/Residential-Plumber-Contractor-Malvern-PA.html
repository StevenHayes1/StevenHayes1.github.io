<p>Know that softened water consists of trace amounts of salt. An 8-ounce glass of water includes about the very same quantity of salt as a slice of bread. That's not quite salt, however for those on a stringent sodium-free diet plan it may be excessive. If this doesn't work, you may need to replace one of your toilet's elements, normally the flapper. There might likewise be an issue with the chain connected to the flapper or the float ball. A plumber can quickly replace these parts.</p>
