<p>Backflow preventers are important for producing a safe water supply system. No matter which model you select, all water softeners need to be properly maintained. The brine option should be combined and saved in the salt water tank. Periodic clogging of the resin likewise requires unique attention. For instance, if the raw water supply is turbid it might clog the resin with mud and clay. Sometimes, typical backwashing with water will solve this issue. If not, gradually stir the resin during the backwash cycle to help break up the product. Similarly, germs and fungis also form mats in the resin that reduce its efficiency. Decontaminating the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will get rid of these annoyances. Nevertheless, read the maker's guidelines prior to adding any chemicals to the system.</p>

We decided to stick with Joe, although we felt Mr Rooter rates were definitely on the high end. This being posted by Barbara Boyer from Atlanta.</p>
