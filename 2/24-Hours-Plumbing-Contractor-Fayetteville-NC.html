<p>The next step we must carry out in the repair procedure, is to flush the incoming water line. After we have cleaned the body, and the repaired elements are still out of the body, and we have completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we should open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or debris. This can be challenging, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is necessary that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and debris even if some sort of water collection system needs to be made use of to ensure the line is effectively flushed.</p>
<p>The customer has one month to finish installation and testing of a backflow prevention assembly (check the due date on Notification of Requirements form). Most of the time, a professional plumber can come out and find the problem and make the repairs. In some instances, the toilet might be too old, and replacement parts are not available, so a replacement toilet is required.</p>
