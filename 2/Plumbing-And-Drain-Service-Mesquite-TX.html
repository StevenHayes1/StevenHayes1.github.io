When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the sprinkler system back into the local water system, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can become contaminated. There is potential for the polluted water to become a health danger if allowed to re-enter the water supply. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected frequently for efficiency, in addition to checked annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
