<p>The majority of plumbers will get rid of the old unit to install the new one at the exact same per hour rate. This can increase the amount of time required to install the brand-new system, therefore increasing costs. This actually depends on what condition the rest of the pipes remain in, and how hard the old system is to remove. In many cases, elimination will only add an additional $25 to $50 to the total costs, however in many cases the costs might be higher if extra pipes should likewise be replaced.</p>
