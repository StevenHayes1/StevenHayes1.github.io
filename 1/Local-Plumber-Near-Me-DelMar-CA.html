<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing DelMar CA</h3>
<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
