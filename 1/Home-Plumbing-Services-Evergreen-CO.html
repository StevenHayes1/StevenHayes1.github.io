A permit is not required for repairs which involve just the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of interruptions provided modifications are not made in the existing piping or fixtures. A normal water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a brief, large salt water tank. The softener tank is connected to the house's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube connects the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a neighboring drain or drywell.</p>
