<h3>Quality Plumbing Services In Sparta MI</h3>
<p>Backflow indicates the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they must be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
