<p>Just recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and determine the reason for the issue. The line was plainly deteriorating; some sections were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog was imminent. Even worse, the line could collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
