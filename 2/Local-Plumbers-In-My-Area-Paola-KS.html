<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Paola KS</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This causes cracks in the tubing that can cause leaks. As these leaks happen, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to weaken. Lastly, chlorinated water has actually been found to trigger cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best solution to all of these problems.</p>
