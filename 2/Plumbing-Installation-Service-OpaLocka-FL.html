That sluggish, consistent outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing totally. We cut away the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll find scummy surfaces, water spots and deterioration.
