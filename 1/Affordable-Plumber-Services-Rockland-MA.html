<p>Your company has been extremely valuable to me for some time. The young man who came a few days ago was so honest with me. I was prepared to spend at least $500 for a hot water system and he stated it wasn't necessary!!!! He might have installed the system and I 'd never ever have known the difference. That's a quality service. . Installing a waste disposal unit is a relatively simple job for an experienced do-it-yourselfer. Get a couple of standard tools and follow our how-to.</p>
