<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is an individual preference. A permit is not required for repairs which involve only the working parts of a faucet or valve or clearance of stoppages provided alterations are not made in the existing piping or components. A common water softener consists of a high, narrow water-softener tank, and a short, large brine tank. The softener tank is linked to the home's water-supply line. A small-diameter fill tube links the brine tank to the softener tank. And a discharge hose runs from the softener tank to a close-by drain or drywell.</p>
<p>Our service technician, Tom, was impressive. He was comprehensive, thoughtful, described the work to be done, the cost, choices, and seemed to take the minimum amount of time to complete the work. The technician's assistant, who came along with Tom, was also an excellent property. It was a. fantastic experience for us. But, it always is when we call James A. Wheat & Sons.
