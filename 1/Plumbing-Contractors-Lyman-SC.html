<h3>Plumbing & HVAC Service Lyman SC</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
