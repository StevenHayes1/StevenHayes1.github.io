Fire security system are developed to match the risk that exists in the areas they are set up in. As building types and contents of these buildings can be very different, we need to understand that the fire security system for any installation requires to be developed and installed to fulfill that particular hazard or need. An airplane hangar will need an extremely different fire protection system than the system required in an apartment building. The backflow security requirements for these two examples would also differ considerably.</p>
