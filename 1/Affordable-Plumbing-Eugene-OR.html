<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are appliances that remove calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium.

After travelling through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>

Blanc likewise built a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning big commercial and municipal sewer pipes. An enhanced version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable television. It was ceased in 1973.</p>
