Increases in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
