<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place.

Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
