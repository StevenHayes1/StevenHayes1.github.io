<p>Water softening describes the elimination of magnesium, calcium, and other minerals from water. The most popular technique of water softening is through a process called ion exchange.

While particle size reduction and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" however rather "water conditioning".</p>
