A water softener addresses one of the most disastrous and prevalent water problems: tough water.  Tough water ruined the modern-day house. Scale builds up in your pipes, obstructing them and reducing water pressure.  Scale dramatically reduces the life-span of appliances like dishwashers, coffee machine and ice machines.

That slow, continuous outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing completely. We removed the fronts and backs of new toilets to show you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so beautiful inside. You'll discover scummy surface areas, water spots and rust.
