<p>Sometimes, our professionals will advise that you replace your hot water heater instead of purchase repairs.

Set a pail under the P-trap and detach the drains. Then remove the sink strainer. Eliminate any excess putty.</p>

<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor MapleValley WA</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a much better alternative to polybutylene and galvanized piping. Unfortunately, one brand is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a lot of oxidization. This causes fractures in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leakages happen, zinc is seeped from the fittings on the pipes, causing them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has been discovered to cause fractures in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the very best option to all of these problems.</p>
