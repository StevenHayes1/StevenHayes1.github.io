Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. Most home centers bring only one or more 10-in. designs and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet.
