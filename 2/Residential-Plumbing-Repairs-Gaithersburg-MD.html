<p>He dug two holes on either side of the pipe and was able to blast the old, broken pipe out while replacing it with a brand-new one at the same time. We did a follow-up call to the homeowner several weeks later on, and she reported no excess water in her yard. Task well done: You do not want to wind up with gunk and water all over your kitchen floor. Leaving the task to a qualified plumber guarantees a smooth installation process.</p>
<p>In addition to the garbage disposal unit, there are a variety of upgrades and parts that you might need to think about when weighing the garbage disposal installation cost. For instance, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure. If there is a break or high demand for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, reduced or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and cause a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
