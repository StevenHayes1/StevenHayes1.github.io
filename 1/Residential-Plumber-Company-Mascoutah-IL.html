<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is heated up directly whenever it's needed. Tankless systems particularly utilize an element that heats up water when the tap is turned on. The water is continuously heated as long as the tap stays on. The water stops being heated if the tap is instantly switched off. The heating temperature level is normally pre-set to match your needs and preferences. Due to the fact that they just heat water when needed, tankless electric water heaters utilize less power than traditional water heaters.</p>
