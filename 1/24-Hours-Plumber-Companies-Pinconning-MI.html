After we have cleaned the body, and the fixed parts are still out of the body, and we have actually completed all of our part replacement and cleaning, we need to open the inlet shut off to flush any rust or debris. This can be tricky, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is essential that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system has to be used to assure the line is effectively flushed.</p>
<p>Leaks can occur if the seal in between the tank and bowl fails, or the seal at the floor drain stops working.

Toilets are heavy and if you drop it you have a much more costly repair. Ryan's Plumbing has actually thoroughly trained personnel who will treat your toilet and home with the utmost care.</p>
