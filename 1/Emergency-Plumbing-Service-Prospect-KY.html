WaterBoss ® utilizes great mesh resin - smaller sized beads that really offer more surface area to soften water. This resin is vacuum-packed to enable maximum capability in a minimum of space. Plus, our patented Directional Circulation Screen system assists make sure that no resin bead goes unused. Our screens and whole-house dirt and sediment filter likewise secure the resin bed, so we do not need to waste area on freeboard" which is the empty area in standard water softeners that permit a churning of resin during regeneration to release hardness, dirt and sediment.</p>

When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regeneration immediately begins. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regeneration generally occurs every 12,000 gallons.</p>
