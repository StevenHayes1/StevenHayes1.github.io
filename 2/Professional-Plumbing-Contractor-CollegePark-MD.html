<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and pricey plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. Plumbing problems aren't simply difficult to discover, they're also efficient in causing some major damage.

That's far too little to trigger a drop in water pressure, or any of the other symptoms that might alert of a leak in the system.
