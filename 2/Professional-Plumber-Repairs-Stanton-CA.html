If it's totally full, it will take a bit to clear through the waste, and if you find you forgot something, you need to wait up until it's done to put the new waste in.</p>
<p>If you're buying a new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't around 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many house centers carry only one or two 10-in. designs and no 14-in. models. Be prepared to spend much more if you have to special-order a toilet. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" model, the door might not close. Keep reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
