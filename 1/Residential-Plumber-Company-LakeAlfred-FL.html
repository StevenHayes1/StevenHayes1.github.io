<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has actually been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come online to add circulation rate capacity. During durations of low flow need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow innovation, and it's probably the most essential innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
