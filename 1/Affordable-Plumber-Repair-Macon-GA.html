<h3>Golden Rules To Follow In Plumbing Emergencies Macon GA</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a big, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively adapt to your organisation' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high circulation demand, tanks come online to include circulation rate capability. During periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This new method to softening is called progressive or responsive flow technology, and it's probably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
