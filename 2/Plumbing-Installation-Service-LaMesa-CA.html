<p>Offering quality and professional repair, replacement, and installation services for your plumbing. Some jurisdictions also permit alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district requires all residential systems providing devoted sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system.
