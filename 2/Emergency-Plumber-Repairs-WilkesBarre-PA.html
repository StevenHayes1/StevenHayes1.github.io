The waste disposal unit is among the most misused devices in the entire house.

Large amounts of food can quickly overwhelm the system and cause a substantial clog. That's why Pratt Plumbing gets numerous telephone call asking for waste disposal unit repairs and maintenance.</p>
<p>The majority of disposals will last between 10 and 12 years before needing replacement.

I 'd enjoy to post some pictures of this. Just search line. The problem does exist.</p>
