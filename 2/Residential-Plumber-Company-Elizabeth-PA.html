<p>When the information collected from the field test indicates the assembly has deteriorated in its efficiency listed below the developed minimum basic, backflow preventers need to only be fixed. The test treatment is a diagnostic examination of the functions of a backflow preventer. When the backflow preventer stops working to fulfill this minimum basic, the backflow preventer need to be fixed or if required, replaced. These minimum standards are set at a level that as the backflow prevention assembly starts to degrade in its performance, it can still avoid backflow. The purpose of a repair is to return the assembly back to its original factory working requirements. This means the assembly is fixed so that it can perform above the minimum standard.</p>
