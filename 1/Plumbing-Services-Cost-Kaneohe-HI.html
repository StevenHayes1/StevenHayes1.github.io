<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc designed and developed a smaller sized design that ran on the exact same principle but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also constructed a much bigger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and featured a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable.
