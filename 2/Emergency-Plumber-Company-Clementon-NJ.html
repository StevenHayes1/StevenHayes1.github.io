<p>I had a major sewer concern with a 1940s house, with rainwater and sewage was backing up into the basement shower. I started calling any number I could find on Google. I in fact got their number for another company that couldn't come soon enough however referred me to Rate Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me an estimate. They right away cleared the initial obstruction, permitting the renters to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon additional examination, there was a significant obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After repairing this preliminary concern and installing a protective liner, it was determined that there was yet another break existed. This took place yet a third time as they worked their way through our 70+- year-old concrete sewer.</p>
