<p>If you're purchasing a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the large bulk of toilets, the drain is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To check the rough-in, simply measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring only one or more 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest a lot more. Also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with a lengthened" design, the door may not close. Read on to discover how to install a toilet.</p>

Many plumbers charge in between $45 and $65 per hour, with a lot of disposal installations running $50 per hour for three hours overall, making the labor expenses approximately $150.</p>

I would suggest Marin H2O for any plumbing concern. They are well-informed and very professional. Drainage and water pipe damage might be triggered by nails, screws, and other fasteners. A Baffle - A sink baffle beings in the sink flange and helps smother the sound of the disposal system. It also stops big things from going into the disposal system and avoids upward sprinkling when the unit is on.</p>
