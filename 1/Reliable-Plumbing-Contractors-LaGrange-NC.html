<p>State you choose to go that route. The next concern is whether or not you can install it yourself. Put it this way, if you're a skilled useful person, but you've never ever managed this specific repair, you can most likely do it, providing you do your research. I would fix a limit at trying to install a power-vented gas-fired water heater (and some other specific models). Their installation should be handled by a licensed mechanical or plumbing contractor.</p>
<p>In most cases, a lack of warm water is caused by a faulty circuit breaker or a broken high-temperature cutoff switch. The dip tube inside the tank might be split if the water is lukewarm. Scalding water is generally the result of a broken pressure relief valve or a bad thermostat. In either case, scalding water is dangerous and ought to be immediately addressed by a qualified plumbing professional.</p>
