<p>Deterioration is an intricate phenomenon and there are numerous aspects that speed up deterioration in the drinking-water circulation system and facility plumbing. For years, there has actually been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and deterioration, making it crucial to distinguish between naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is destructive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not contribute to any factors that speed up deterioration Likewise, there is an absence of scientific proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of corrosion control. Hence, considering all these factors, as well as arise from research studies, WQA's position is that an appropriately set up cation -exchange water softener does not make water more corrosive.</p>
