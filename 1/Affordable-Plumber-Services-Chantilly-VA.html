<p>The next step we need to perform in the repair procedure, is to flush the inbound water line. After we have cleaned up the body, and the fixed components are still out of the body, and we have actually finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet turned off to flush any rust or particles. This can be challenging, especially when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be splashed around. It is very important that the inlet valve be opened to flush this dirt and particles even if some sort of water collection system needs to be made use of to ensure the line is effectively flushed.</p>
