Depending on your requirements, you might need more than one tankless hot water heater to satisfy your day-to-day warm water demands.</p>
<p>Throughout installation, water and electricity are turned off to the area. The old plumbing and sink flange are gotten rid of and cleaned of any putty.

Place a container beneath the drain pipe to catch any water that leaks out.</p>
