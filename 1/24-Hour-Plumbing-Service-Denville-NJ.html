Mr. Singh did at least three attempts to clear the main drain, however the downstairs sink still had standing water in the bowl. Using his knowledge and experience he figured out that the drain system from the upstairs sink was clear but the backup was in the branch to the downstairs sink. With a little coaxing, much to my delight, the sink cleared and all the debris decreased the freshly cleaned up main drain.
