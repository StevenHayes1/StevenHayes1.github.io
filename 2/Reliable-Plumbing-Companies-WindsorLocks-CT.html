<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To just put some media inside a tank and expect the best is common in our market and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and thorough testing led us to create a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly interacting that you can accomplish this.</p>
