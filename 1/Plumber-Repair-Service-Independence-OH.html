<p>A lot of toilets used today operate with a basic gravity flushing style, suggesting they use the force of the gravity to push the clean water into the bowl and after that on into the sewage system. Just recently, however, toilets utilizing a vacuum flushing system have been appearing in more and more homes. This system uses a vacuum-assisted flushing mechanism to suck the water into the bowl and down into the drains. A downside of this device is that it's much more hard to unclog your toilet were to end up being clogged.</p>
