<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they should be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
