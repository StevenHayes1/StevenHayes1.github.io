<h3>Plumber Plumbing Contractor Bellevue WA</h3>
<p>Now wait a minute, some individuals state, does not the water pressure in the water system keep the watering water from reversing? Yes, the majority of the time it does. However, there are times when the water pressure drops in the supply system, and this is when the backflow happens. No, it is not a regular occurrence, however it does happen more frequently than you believe! Frequently it happens in the evening when you do not discover the water was off for a few minutes. An example is when the water company has to shut off the water to repair a water pipe, or link a new pipe. This makes construction tasks easily the most typical reason for backflow problems. Fire fighting is another typical reason for backflow. Fire trucks utilize big pumps to draw the water out of the fire hydrants. This frequently causes the water pressure in the surrounding areas to drop, and backflow will occur in the surrounding communities.</p>
