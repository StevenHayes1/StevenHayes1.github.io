<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Pelion SC</h3>
<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is adversely charged and has space to hold on to positive ions. The fresh media starts by holding on to the weaker charged salt ions. As hard water passes through your water softener tank, the more powerful charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Given that the hardness minerals have a greater positive charge than the salt, they will knock the sodium ions off and take their location.</p>
<p>Really often the circular blade within is stuck. DO NOT REACH INSIDE TO FREE IT! Simply insert a long, durable, wood manage (a broom handle will be adequate) into the opening. Let it rest against the within wall, and with force pushing down, turn clockwise up until you feel it turn easily. It might be needed to reset the disposal. Find the reset switch on the bottom of the unit if so. If the clog continues, use any kind of drain cleaner to free it.</p>
