<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and determine the cause of the issue. The line was clearly degrading; some areas were just held together by the ground around them. Another clog loomed. Even even worse, the line might collapse needing a major repair or replacement.</p>
