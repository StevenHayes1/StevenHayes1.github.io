Once again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the solidity in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperature levels. It's only with the media and the fluidization correctly collaborating that you can achieve this.</p>
