<p>Water softeners overcome a process called ion exchange which removes calcium and magnesium from the water. When the difficult water enters into the mineral tank, it flows through a bed of round resin beads These plastic beads, generally made from polystyrene, are charged with a salt ion. The resin beads are anions, suggesting they have an unfavorable charge. The calcium and magnesium minerals have a positive charge, making them cations. Since opposite charges draw in, the unfavorable charge of the minerals is attracted to the positive charge of the resin beads. As the tough water travels through the resin, the beads get ahold of the mineral ions and remove them from the water. When the bead seizes the mineral ion, the salt ion is launched. The column of resin strips all the firmness out of the water as it goes through the mineral tank, and softened water flows out into your home.</p>
