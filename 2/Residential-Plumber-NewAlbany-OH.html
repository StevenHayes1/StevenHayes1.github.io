<p>After arriving after their window, they began to examine the kitchen sink (and after among the two gentlemen threw up outdoors), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but declared they wouldn't take duty if it leaked now since of some unspecified oddities in how my sink was assembled. After they offered me the "don't put grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I discovered they managed to reassemble the sink in such a way that the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even bother to attempt calling them back, since I never ever wish to see this company once again.</p>
<p>Your company has been extremely helpful to me for some time. The young man who came a few days ago was so truthful with me. I was prepared to invest at least $500 for a hot water system and he stated it wasn't required!!!! He might have set up the system and I 'd never have actually understood the distinction. That's a quality business. . Installing a waste disposal unit is a fairly easy project for an experienced do-it-yourselfer. Grab a couple of standard tools and follow our how-to.</p>
