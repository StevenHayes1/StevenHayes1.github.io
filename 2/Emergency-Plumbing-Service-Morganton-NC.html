<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine proved effective, Sam Blanc developed and constructed a smaller model that ran on the very same principle but could clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains as well as laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also built a much larger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It needed to be pulled by a truck and featured a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable television. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and local sewer pipes. An improved version called "The Mainliner" was presented in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable. It was ceased in 1973.</p>
