<p>The FutureSoft water softener media is just half the formula! To simply put some media inside a tank and expect the very best is normal in our industry and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and comprehensive testing led us to develop a tank that fluidizes the media bed better than any other style on the marketplace. Fluidization is the key to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not adhere to anything even under severe temperatures.
