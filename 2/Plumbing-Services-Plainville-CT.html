<p>Backflow suggests the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from happening. Points at which a drinkable water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
