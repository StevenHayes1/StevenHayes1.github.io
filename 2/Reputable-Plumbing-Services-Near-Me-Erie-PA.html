Toilet continues to run - Either fill device has stopped working to shutoff or is out of modification sending out water into the bowl. Toilet flapper is worn and no longer sealing water from getting in bowl.</p>
<p>Leaks can happen if the seal between the tank and bowl fails, or the seal at the floor drain fails. Since the tank or the whole toilet should be raised off the floor for a proper repair, either of these leaks can be tough to fix by yourself. Toilets are heavy and if you drop it you have a far more pricey repair. Ryan's Plumbing has carefully trained personnel who will treat your toilet and home with the utmost care.</p>
<p>Press the suggestion of a screwdriver up against the edge of the plug and tap up until you break loose the plug. Then eliminate this plastic disc from inside the disposal (you can most likely hold the unit upside down and shake it out). There are different types and designs of sink faucets, and your Good Guy plumber understands how to repair them all, and can also use installation of a new faucet if required.

Proper care and garbage disposal maintenance will keep it running long past its service warranty and keep your drain lines clear.</p>
