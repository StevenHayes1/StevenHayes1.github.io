Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promo have actually been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
<p>If your old sink flange is intact and tight, with no signs of leak, you can probably leave it in location. Possibilities are good that the mounting brackets on the new unit will fit just fine.

<p>Each resin bead or zeolite crystal is adversely charged and has area to hold on to favorable ions. The fresh media starts by holding on to the weaker charged salt ions. As difficult water travels through your water softener tank, the stronger charged calcium or magnesium are pulled to the media like a magnet. Since the hardness minerals have a greater favorable charge than the salt, they will knock the salt ions off and take their place.</p>
