It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an exact movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air must be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from vital locations in the assembly.
