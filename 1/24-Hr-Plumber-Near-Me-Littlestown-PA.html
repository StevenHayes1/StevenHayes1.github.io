As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water takes a trip through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some areas than others. While the minerals will not hurt your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and quite a nuisance-- for its numerous desired uses around your home.</p>
<p>Poorly set up gas lines lead to gas leaks. Gas leakages are expensive to repair. Gas line installation is not a do-it-yourself task.

It is the second greatest energy consuming area of a house, beside cooling and heating. The quantity of minerals dissolved in water can cause it to take longer for water to heat, increasing those energy expenses.</p>
