I in fact received their number for another company that could not come quickly enough but referred me to Cost Buster's. Bo and company had the ability to come out within 12 hours to investigate and give me a price quote. They immediately cleared the preliminary clog, enabling the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon more examination, there was a substantial blockage that needed excavation to examine. His team was on website the really next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this initial problem and setting up a protective liner, it was identified that there was yet another break existed.
