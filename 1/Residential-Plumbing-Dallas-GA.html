<p>Sometimes you know you have a sewer line break because you can smell nasty smells or you have a sewage back-up in your home. It is important to pinpoint the exact location of the break in your sewer line. Oftentimes the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and knowing this can conserve you thousands of dollars in repairs. Merely sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can solve the problem. The service technicians and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you constantly have a copy for your insurance real estate agent, company or city inspector.</p>
