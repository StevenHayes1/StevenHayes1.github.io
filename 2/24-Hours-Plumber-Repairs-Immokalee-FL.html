<p>Backflow preventers are vital for creating a safe supply of water system. No matter which model you select, all water softeners need to be correctly kept. The brine solution should be mixed and saved in the brine tank. Regular blocking of the resin also requires unique attention.

If not, slowly stir the resin throughout the backwash cycle to help break up the product. Also, fungis and germs likewise form mats in the resin that decrease its efficiency. Sanitizing the water prior to softening or periodically cleaning the softener with chlorine bleach will eliminate these annoyances.
