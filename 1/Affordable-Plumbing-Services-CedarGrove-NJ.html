<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing CedarGrove NJ</h3>
<p>PEX pipes were believed to be a better alternative to galvanized and polybutylene piping. Regrettably, one brand name is experiencing a lot of problems: Dura PEX. Dura PEX tends to have a great deal of oxidization. This triggers cracks in the tubing that can result in leakages. As these leaks take place, zinc is leached from the fittings on the pipes, triggering them to degrade. Finally, chlorinated water has been discovered to cause cracks in the clamps on these pipes. Repiping is the best option to all of these problems.</p>
