<p>To identify which toilet valve is causing the problem, look at the overflow tube. If water is overruning into television, there's an issue with the toilet fill valve. If the water level is listed below the top of television, the flush valve is leaking, enabling water to trickle into the bowl. That sluggish, continuous outflow of water avoids the fill valve from closing entirely. We removed the fronts and backs of brand-new toilets to reveal you how to replace these toilet tank parts. Your toilet and toilet tank parts won't look so pristine inside. You'll find scummy surface areas, water stains and corrosion. But do not be squeamish-- the water is as clean as the stuff that comes out of your faucets.</p>
