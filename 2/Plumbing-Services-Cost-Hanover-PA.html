<h3>Garden Sprinkler Systems in Hanover Pennsylvania</h2>

Deterioration can also split, break, or burst pipes and destroy your walls or floorings. We fix small leaks without repiping, but if you experience chronic leak or a slab leak, it might be time for a complete plumbing overhaul.</p>

<p>Pre-action sprinkler systems typically are set up in areas where water could cause devastating damage, such as in freezers, computer rooms, and locations with electronic equipment. The piping in a pre-action system consists of air or nitrogen, which can be pressurized or non-pressurized. Water to the system is held back by the pre-action valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire occurs, the detection system sends a signal that opens the pre-action valve, which then permits water into the system's piping. The water is released through the open sprinkler.</p>
