Salt ions are held loosely and are replaced quickly by calcium and magnesium ions. Throughout this process, free" salt ions are launched into the water.

<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
