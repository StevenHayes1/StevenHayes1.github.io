<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for people on low salt diet plans. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to reduce its mineral content. Normally, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of salt per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more sodium, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this boost in sodium is minor, however if you have actually been recommended by a physician to follow a rigorous low sodium diet this increase can position problems.</p>

When water enters your house from the main water supply line, it should just ever stream in one direction: into your home.</p>
<p>A new pattern in re-piping is sand blasting the within worn thin pipe and the painting the within the worn pipe with epoxy paint. Often during the sandblasting the sandblasting will use thin and blow through the wall of joints and pipes. A few of those thin spots leak right away and often those leaks come days or weeks later.

Broken Pipes: Pipes are split, punctured or collapsed by moving soil, frozen ground, settling, and so on</p>
