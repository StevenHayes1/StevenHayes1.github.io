<p>After arriving after their window, they started to investigate the kitchen sink (and after one of the 2 gentlemen threw up outside), they ran a snake down the sink and then put the sink back together but claimed they would not take obligation if it dripped now because of some unspecified curiosity in how my sink was put together. After they offered me the "do not pour grease down the sink" lecture and they left, I noticed they handled to reassemble the sink in such a manner in which the sprayer hose was twisted around the plumbing. I didn't even trouble to attempt calling them back, since I never wish to see this company once again.</p>
<p>Although these house owners didn't feel fortunate at the time, it was certainly great timing to camera the line prior to collapsing. The pipe remained in good enough shape to reline prior to the problem became worse. Waiting just wasn't an option. The line was 12 feet deep and went under a separated garage. At the least, it would have been a really costly alternative.</p>
