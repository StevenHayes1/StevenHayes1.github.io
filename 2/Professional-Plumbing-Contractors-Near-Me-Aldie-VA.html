<p>Back-siphonage is the reverse from regular flow instructions within a piping system that is brought on by negative pressure in the supply piping (i.e., the turnaround of regular flow in a system triggered by a vacuum or partial vacuum within the supply of water piping). Back-siphonage can take place when there is a high speed in a pipe line, when there is a line repair or break that is lower than a service point, or when there is lowered main pressure due to high-water withdrawal rate (such as during fire-fighting or water-main flushing).</p>
<p>An RPBA is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of two separately acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and listed below the first check valve. It consists of shutoff valves at each end of the assembly and is geared up with test dicks. An RPBA works against backpressure backflow and backsiphonage and may be utilized to separate health or non-health dangers.</p>
