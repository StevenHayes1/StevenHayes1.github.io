<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to know the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To examine the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. A lot of home centers bring only one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest far more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl extends from the wall. If you are replacing a toilet with a basic bowl with an elongated" model, the door might not close. Read on to learn how to install a toilet.</p>

You'll also find a drain valve near the tank bottom, and a control unit outside for setting temperatures and controlling the pilot-light valve.</p>
