<h3>Emergency Plumbing Repair Kailua HI</h3>
<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to standard softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to manage peak flow rates, an MTS utilizes a series of smaller tanks to effectively get used to your company' flow rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to include flow rate capacity. Throughout periods of low circulation need, tanks go off-line. This brand-new method to softening is called responsive or progressive flow technology, and it's arguably the most crucial innovation in commercial water conditioning in the previous 50 years.</p>
