ABS and PVC are not in fact glued in the routine sense of gluing. The so-called "glue" is really a solvent that melts the surfaces of the pipe and fitting for a couple of seconds. Broken Pipes: Pipes are cracked, punctured or collapsed by moving soil, frozen ground, settling, etc</p>
<p>As the name recommends, a backflow preventer works to make sure that liquids do not flow back against the needed direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire sprinkler system, a backflow preventer device is used to ensure that water does not stream from the sprinkler system back into the local supply of water, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. If enabled to return to the water system, there is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health risk. The backflow preventer is meant to prevent water flowing back towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be inspected regularly for efficiency, along with inspected yearly by a fire inspection company in order to guarantee they are working as they should.</p>
