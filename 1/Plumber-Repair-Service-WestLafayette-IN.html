Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully designed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
