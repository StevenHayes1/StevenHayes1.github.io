<p>Rust is a complex phenomenon and there are many elements that accelerate deterioration in the drinking-water circulation system and facility plumbing. For many years, there has been confusion surrounding cation -exchange softened water and rust, making it crucial to compare naturally soft water and cation -exchange softened water Naturally soft water is corrosive as it has a low pH and low TDS; however, cation -exchange water softening does not add to any factors that speed up corrosion Likewise, there is an absence of clinical proof supporting the claim that hard-water scale is a reliable form of rust control. Thus, considering all these aspects, as well as arise from research study studies, WQA's position is that a properly configured cation -exchange water softener does not make water more destructive.</p>

<p>Recently we were called by a couple to unclog a main sewer line between their brand-new house and the city sewer. After clearing the drain we used our sewer camera to examine the line and identify the cause of the problem. The line was plainly weakening; some sections were only held together by the ground around them. Another clog impended. Even even worse, the line might collapse needing a significant repair or replacement.</p>
