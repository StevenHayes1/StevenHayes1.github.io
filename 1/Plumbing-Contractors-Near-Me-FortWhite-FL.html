<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first shot using non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Merely pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, include some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. If that does not work, you can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners contain focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really damaging if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the suitable safety measures if using one of these products.</p>

<p>Often you understand you have a sewer line break due to the fact that you can smell foul smells or you have a sewage back-up in your house. It is essential to pinpoint the specific place of the break in your sewer line. Oftentimes the break can be on the city side of the sewer line and knowing this can save you countless dollars in repairs. Just sharing a copy of your sewer line video with the city inspector can solve the problem. The professionals and plumbers at Jim Dandy Sewer and Plumbing can make a copy of your sewer scope video on a thumb drive so that you constantly have a copy for your insurance real estate agent, city or company inspector.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is normally the offender. But not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing firmly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger trouble too. Photo 3 demonstrates how to set the slack just right.</p>
