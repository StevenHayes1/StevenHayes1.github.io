<h3>The Dreaded Blocked Toilet at Hollywood FL</h3>
<p>For a fire-sprinkler system to run, the control valve or valves must stay open and the system should be continually monitored. For that reason, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed. This device can be as basic as a locked chain through the control valve that prevents that valve from opening, or an alarm that alerts the fire department when the valve is closed. Some systems use both approaches. NFPA 13 describes all such gadgets as supervisory devices.</p>
