<p>Other pipe repair techniques include our Pipe Pull technique and pipe relining.

All new replacement pipes have actually a forecasted lifespan of one hundred years and are code compliant, chemical-resistant, root-resistant, and leak proof. Another effective technique is pipe relining. Pipe relining essentially eliminates the need for broken pipe elimination. By placing a hardening lining material which coats the within the existing pipe, a new pipe is created inside the broken one.</p>
