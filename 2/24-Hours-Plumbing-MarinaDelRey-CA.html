<p>New England Pipe Remediation is the premier sewer repair provider in the Northeast.

However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an alternative to consider if you live in an older house - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for lots of decades, but steel eventually experiences deterioration and lacks the durability of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
