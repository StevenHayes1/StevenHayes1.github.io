Blanc likewise constructed a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be towed by a truck and included a 10 hp gasoline engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning big industrial and community sewer pipes.

To simply pour some media inside a tank and hope for the best is normal in our industry and lots of companies attempt to get away with it. That is not the case with the FutureSoft system. Again, years of experience and extensive testing led us to design a tank that fluidizes the media bed much better than any other design on the market. Fluidization is the essential to forming calcite crystals. The FutureSoft media converts the hardness in the water to calcite crystals which will not stay with anything even under extreme temperatures.
