After we have actually cleaned the body, and the repaired elements are still out of the body, and we have finished all of our part replacement and cleaning, we must open the inlet shut down to flush any rust or particles. This can be challenging, specifically when the backflow prevention assembly is set up inside an area where water can not be wallowed.
