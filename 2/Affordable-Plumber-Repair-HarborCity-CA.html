<p>SofTap's water softening innovation is well-suited for household, commercial, and commercial applications, including the prevention of limescale build-up in families and scaling in commercial water treatment systems, along with improving existing reverse osmosis treatment systems. The technology is simpler and more cost-effective than other softening systems on the market today that utilize zeolites, which should be restored using salt water, or membrane nanofiltration that requires significant water use and high pressure.</p>
<p>If you're purchasing a new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the huge majority of toilets, the waste pipe is centered about 12 in. from the wall. However with a few designs, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just measure from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. If that measurement (plus the thickness of the baseboard) isn't approximately 12 in., toilet shopping will be a bit harder. Many home centers carry just one or 2 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you have to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. Likewise measure how far the bowl extends from the wall if there's a door near the toilet. If you are replacing a toilet with a standard bowl with a lengthened" model, the door may not close. Continue reading to discover how to install a toilet.</p>
