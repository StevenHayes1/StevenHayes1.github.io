<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of one or more afflicted locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to just desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>

<p>Softeners generally get rid of calcium (Ca2+) and magnesium (Mg2+) ions. Calcium and magnesium are frequently described as 'firmness minerals'. In addition, if your pipes are rattling, clanging, clacking and making more sound than they should be (more than water streaming through the pipes), that's a huge red flag that something more serious is incorrect with them.</p>
<p>Also, if you have a 2-story home, it'll be more costly to repipe due to the fact that the plumber will need to navigate through walls to do the job. Repiping plumbing lines in your house is a big task - and it's a job you want to get right. But the series of plumbing pipe materials to choose from can make it confusing. Here we take a look at a few of the attributes of the major pipe types to help you select the right pipe for your plumbing.</p>
