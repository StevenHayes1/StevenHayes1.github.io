<p>As the name suggests, a backflow preventer works to ensure that liquids do not flow back against the needed direction of circulation. When utilized in the context of a fire lawn sprinkler, a backflow preventer device is used to guarantee that water does not flow from the lawn sprinkler back into the community water supply, or other source of drinking water. Unfortunately, water kept in the sprinkler system can end up being contaminated. If allowed to re-enter the supply of water, there is potential for the polluted water to end up being a health threat. The backflow preventer is meant to avoid water receding towards the main supply. Backflow preventers need to be checked frequently for effectiveness, in addition to inspected annually by a fire inspection company in order to ensure they are working as they should.</p>
