<p>The system has actually gone back to a zero demand condition (no valves open downstream). Nevertheless, particles between the # 1 Check Valve seat and sealing disc, or damage in the elements, is avoiding the # 1 Check from closing all the method.

When this happens, the Relief Valve Spring presses back against the Relief Valve Diaphram, opening the Recreational Vehicle Discharge.</p>
<p>At least as soon as every 3 months, drain water from the tank. Over time sediment builds at the bottom of the heater, which can hinder performance, and draining a gallon approximately helps get rid of the sediment.
