<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the first most apparent indications of a sewer concern is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the lawn (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple issue such as a broken water seal, or it can show a bigger concern such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid severe damage to your house. Even if the issue stems with the community system, it's still smart to generate the specialists to restrict the damage to your home.</p>
